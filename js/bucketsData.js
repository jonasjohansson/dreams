The Biggest Hole is no mere cavity in the ground; it is a testament to human tenacity, a shrine to our insatiable curiosity, and an ever-expanding enigma forged by sweat, willpower, and an unyielding desire to push limits.\n\nWhy do we dig? Because we refuse to accept the surface-level existence imposed upon us. Because depth—literal and philosophical—demands exploration. Because we are not idle spectators of this world but pioneers of the unknown, driven to unearth what lies beneath, whether treasure, truth, or the sheer satisfaction of defying gravity’s grasp.\n\nBut ambition without means is mere fantasy. A hole of this magnitude demands tools, time, and a legion of fearless souls prepared to tear into the earth and leave behind something so audacious, so incomprehensibly vast, that it becomes legend. This is why we demand your support. By funding The Biggest Hole, you are not merely sponsoring a project—you are becoming part of a legacy, a sculptural anomaly, a testament to what can be achieved when we cast aside hesitation and embrace the raw, primal act of creation through destruction.\n\nAnd let us not forget the ancient prophecy, whispered for generations, foretelling that only when a hole of unfathomable depth is carved into the sacred ground of The Borderland, will the great subterranean jellyfish emerge to reveal the true meaning of existence. Is this prophecy real? There is only one way to find out.\n\nJoin us. Seize a shovel. Contribute. Witness as we alter the very landscape of The Borderland. This is not just a hole. This is The Biggest Hole—and it will be dug. With or without you.",

And you don't even get a prize. No spoon that's too small for almost any purpose except illicit ones that you get to hang around your neck and celebrate your over-consumption. No cuddly toy or night in a slightly better tent than your tent. You don't even get a sticker. (Actually you do get a sticker).\n\n##   \n  \nQuesticles is a site wide, multi day, multiplayer fully immersive quest game.\n\nQuesticles is a fully immersive quest game / theatre project. For those who play, it will shape their entire event, sending them off in new directions, with new people and giving a focus, of sorts, to their BL experience.\n\n### Strange characters, cursed tales, traps, tricks, short games, long games, a dozen camps collaborating, and a little something for the winners.\n\nLast year more than a few of you not only managed to break your curse - you returned for more challenges! Most of you are still cursed. A whole year of crap music, weird rashes and the inability to climax (a lot like this game!)\n\n### Step into a tantalising mystery world of riddles, mysteries, and monumentally stupid challenges.\n\n## Three things make Questicles a unique experience\n\n1) You won't realise you are playing\n\n2) We don't really want you to play. In fact, we don't really like you very much at all.\n\n3) We will play with you. Like real people.  \nThis is not some nonsense about finding bits of paper or hidden clues or something written in computer software. Real people playing with real people. Like in the good old days before you hippies colonised this swamp. (Go back to denmark!).\n\n4) Even we do not know how to play our game. Our game is formed of puzzles in at least 12 different camps and we don't know what they are or how to complete them. Help us or we'll be stuck at this Burn forever.\n\n5) We cannot count to three.\n\n### **Solve puzzles, break the curse** and ~defeat the Questmaster General to become a hero~. (Edit: you will never be a hero!) Join with other winners and regale all with tales of your triumph.\n\nOur game, and our lore, is needlessly complex. A game that spans time and space. Traverse the entire Borderland-land, from lake to hilltop, forest to swamp, camp to camp, seeking solutions, companions and clues to solve the riddle and lift the curse. Keep a japs-eye out for the Golden Dickheads (Edit: you can't actually say that anymore - please fix this). But beware, they cause curses. Once cursed, you will be tasked with a series of challenges, taking you the length and breadth of the Borderland, on a search for special camps, each one with a game and a story.\n\n## **Why we need your money!**\n\nCan't share too much detail – it's meant to be a mystery, but we are creating...\n\n*   **COSTUMES:** Recognisable theatrical costumes for the Golden Dickheads. Find them and interact to enter the game. If you dare.\n    \n*   **GAME PROPS:** We have a bunch of games for you.

For four years, the Church has tested the sensual limits of what Sweden can experience within the confines of a small, wooden structure in a remote field under the night sky. In our fifth and most unapologetic year, we seek to push the boundaries further. The ritual entity evolves.**\n\nWe provide Borderlings with an intimate yet secure space to explore themselves, guided by some of the finest performers to ever grace our shores on your journey towards bliss. Prepare to be awestruck as our pulsating organ, coupled with a meticulously crafted light show, entices your senses and envelopes you in an aura of sensuality. Our carefully selected sound system will reverberate through you, elevating you to ecstatic heights that polite society would deem untouchable.\n\nBuilding on the success of last year, we will again take a new, unconventional direction. Yes, we will have techno nights. Yes, there will be a play space for your naughty flesh-bound vessel. But we will also explore uncharted creative realms.\n\nOnce again, we offer an environment designed to encourage the exploration of your most visceral and carnal energies in a safe, nurturing space. We aim to develop the concept of inclusive creation that we tested last year with another live performance night on the Friday. Should we receive enough interest and talent, another live performance night will follow. We will need creators—both visual and sonic—to bring this experience to life. If you are one of these creators, connect with us. We are also open to impromptu performers during the festival.\n\nThis year, we plan to use the space more creatively. We’re excited about hosting burlesque performances (reach out if you’re interested in performing!). Personally, I dream of a metal afternoon/evening, because the Church’s vibe aligns perfectly with filthy guitar riffs and explosive blast beats.\n\nWe are also considering curating the basement space, though we welcome other camps or groups to claim it for their own purposes. A kinky, bondage-inspired zone is a possibility for those who dare venture deeper into the darkness.\n\nWhile we are sex-positive during our techno nights, please note that the live performance events will _not_ have a sex-positive focus and will not be monitored by guardians.\n\nAre you a performer? Do you want to host a workshop? Do you want to get married in the Church? Please get in touch with us via email [trwightwick@gmail.com](mailto:trwightwick@gmial.com) or on Discord, almightybob\\_\n\nNot kid-friendly during the nights, some events and workshops during the day will be kid-friendly.",

If a certain Mr J shows up after the performances, then you can almost guarantee that there will be techno into the early hours.\n\nWe are open to collaborating in the basement to host whatever experience you desire. Be mindful, though, that if you want to host something that is kinky and/or sex-positive, you will need to provide bodies to police the area and ensure a safe experience for the guests.\n\nIf you want to join for a cheeky mosh and have some music you would like to play, please feel welcome to bring some tracks on a USB stick and we will see what we can create together.",

Through dynamic light installations—often interactive via touch or voice—we illuminate trees, their trunks, branches, and surroundings, inviting participants to engage with nature through light.\n\nThis iteration introduces a **new mounting system** that prioritises tree health, allowing light fixtures to follow the organic contours of trees. Instead of static rings, flowing light threads adapt to each tree’s form. We’re also exploring **tree-based interactions** like vibration or voice activation for a seamless, natural experience.\n\n### Build\n\nThe DENDROLUX mounting system is designed to be both adaptable and tree-friendly. It consists of welded steel components, durable straps, and transparent acrylic loops, ensuring a secure yet non-invasive attachment. The lighting system features pixel-dense, individually controllable RGB strips (WS2815, 100 pixels per metre), housed in silicone tubing to provide a soft, diffused glow. By following the natural contours of each tree, the installation seamlessly integrates with the environment, creating a flowing, organic illumination rather than rigid geometric shapes. The system is fully modular, allowing for on-site adjustments to fit each location perfectly.\n\n### Interaction\n\nPast versions used microphones, accelerometers, and smartphone inputs. This time, the tree itself is the interface—visitors can touch, hug, or whisper to trigger rippling light sequences. The vision: a multi-tree light orchestra where participants co-create an evolving experience.\n\n### For Borderland 2025\n\nOriginally presented at Into the Woods 2020, DENDROLUX returns with an entirely new mounting system and bespoke interaction model for The Borderland. This iteration moves beyond static rings, instead following the organic form of each tree.\n\nEnhancements include:\n\n*   Tree-borderling interaction: Touch, hug, or whisper to the tree!\n    \n*   Light following tree form: Illumination of branches and shape allow for a more playful overall form that acts as a guide to the trees.\n    \n*   Modular and adaptable mounting system: Designed for on-site adjustments.\n    \n\n### Team\n\n**Olle Bjerkås** – Light sculpture & modular design specialist, leading physical mounting.

By a fireplace, a string with colourful letters welcomes you to Muumimaa!\n\nLittle creatures jump around and cheer, shaking their jiggly marshmallow flesh. Tears of joy, drops of sweat. Music is grooving and pumping. Particle clouds swirl through the air and enter your body. You feel goosebumps!\n\nYou leave your shoes behind and rest on a carpet. Your friend sinks into a couch. You take a look around. There is a bar, and another bar, under the bar, and another – wait. The trees have feet, they walk! Smoke bubbles are gliding through the air. You try to reach, and reach, and – puff.\n\nMaybe this was just a dream!\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nBehind this dream stands a group of friends. We are the Moomins!\n\nSince our first Borderland in 2018, we have been hosting Muumimaa, a sound stage to dance and celebrate togetherness. Welcome!\n\nFirst, we put sound, music, and space to dance. We have been curating lineups with fantastic DJs and live musicians. This year once more, we would like to welcome friends and strangers to our decks. Looking back, each year tells a different tale: [https://soundcloud.com/muumimaa](https://soundcloud.com/muumimaa)\n\nWhat adventures may this year bring? Let's find out! What we know for sure: Muumimaa only happens with a healthy dose of craziness, boldness, heavy lifting – phew!, snackification – mjam, building skills, fluffication, striking, and care!\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWhether this remains a dream or becomes a reality lies in your hands.\n\n\\*\\*\\*",

No, it’s not low impact.\n\n### 🌌 **The ISS Space Shuttle Program: Luggage, Warp, and Wormholes**\n\n**Initiating Mission Protocol…**  \nThe _ISS Space Shuttle_ is not just an artcar. It is a vehicle of transcendence — a shimmering, LED-cloaked celestial cruiser designed to bend time, space, and the minds of unsuspecting hippies.\n\n*   Used **ATV** + sleek **500kg trailer**\n    \n*   Custom _ISS Space shuttle skin_ with lights, sound, neon\n    \n*   Daily night warp-speed shuttle loops of abducted (consentually) groups of Borderlings and delivered to random location while utterly confused by the enclosed mobile mirror capsule cuddle puddle\n    \n*   Rumored to include _Captain Valkyria's onboard DJ set_, _Dr. Flow’s Shibari Debrief Tent_, and _Spontaneous Galactic Blessings - may the force be with you!_\n    \n\n#### 🧳 **Phase I: Sunday Luggage Protocol — Operation Exodus & Arrival**\n\nBefore the rain drops even settles, the **ISS Space Shuttle** activates as a **Borderland migration beacon**, transporting the most sacred cargo of all: **luggage**.\n\n*   On **Sunday arrival**, the ISS intercepts Borderlings fresh from the bus, confused and wide-eyed, guiding them — and their gear — toward their home base with interstellar grace.\n    \n*   On **Sunday strike**, it reverses course, helping worn-out warriors return to the shuttle zone, like a loyal rover answering the call of duty.\n    \n\nNo one carries a backpack alone. No glittered tote left behind.\n\n#### 🌠 **Phase II: Daily Warp Drive – _The Abduction Hour_**\n\nFrom **Monday to Friday**, as the sun begins to drip below the horizon, the ISS initiates **WARP MODE**.\n\n*   This is no ordinary shuttle ride. It is an **abduction ritual**.\n    \n*   Groups of selected or consenting travelers will be boarded onto the ISS trailer — lit entirely in reflective mirror surfaces, layered with pulsating LEDs, glowing strips, and low-frequency vibration pads.\n    \n*   They will be told nothing. Only the words: _\"You have been chosen. Please board.\"_\n    \n\nThen... silence. Movement. A wormhole opens. And they are taken.\n\n*   To where? To whom? Why?  \n    They won’t know until it’s too late.  \n    That’s the point. That’s the magic.\n    \n\n#### 🧬 **Phase III: Wormhole Transportation System – Hippie Displacement Protocol**\n\nDuring the day, the ISS trailer will remain parked, powered by solar mystery and dust logic. But come evening, the mirrors catch the last light. The LEDs pulse awake. The DJ plays tones no one remembers learning, and the **Wormhole Cycle** begins again.\n\nInside the ISS:\n\n*   Reality will blur.\n    \n*   Perception will fragment.\n    \n*   Hippies will disassociate with grace and glee, unsure if they’re still in Sweden or floating above Mars.\n    \n\nWhen they arrive, wherever that is, they’ll disembark reborn.\n\n### ✨ Why It Matters:\n\n**The ISS Space Shuttle is not a tool. It is a myth in motion.**  \nAn offering to the confused. A beacon for the bold.  \nA logistical miracle and a psychedelic prank wrapped in chrome.\n\nTo build it, we need love, tech, and funding.  \nTo ride it, you only need confusion and the courage to get lost in the moment (and some trust in the Space Force who has been trained under very high pressure).\n\n**Beam us up, Borderland. The ISS is ready.**\n\nIf funding is limited, we scale back to _Project Solo Abduction™_, which only needs 3,000–4,000 SEK (motorbike we have - weird cart + vibes).",

In the form of a multi day sculpture tournament, we will practice making intuitive art together and explore the depths of immediacy and communal effort while we go big.\n\nStarted in 2023 as a co-creative flow outside the Barn at Alversjö, The Borderland Sculpture Tournament will contain regular competitions and challenges where all Borderlanders are invited to join the art of co-creative sculpting. Wood and textiles are the materials available, materials that most of us have experience to work with, that allows us to build playfully with intuition. In the evenings, lights will be added to the list of materials so that our inner light artists can turn the sculpture alive.\n\nThe sculpture will grow each day while we get more skilled and synced, offering new artistic experiences and expressions. The last build day is on Friday when a grand final and community ritual will take place in Borderland City.\n\nWith a 100.000 SEK already allocated from fund33, we have a good headstart with lot of material and intercamp collaborations. If you feel called to be creative and produce at Alversjö, in any extent, then this is for you.\n\nIn the budget below, money is allocated to different materials as a percentage rather than specifying exactly what will be bought. After funding is over, we will look for the best possible solution that can deliver high quality materials at a good price.",

Our mission is to turn the area around the buildings in Alversjö into a vibrant city where all Borderlanders can enjoy a constant sense of co-creation surrounded by food, dance, music and huge art. The participating camps have attended multiple Borderlands, during which a lot of knowledge and material resources have been gathered. We have a massive budget, deep knowledge of Alversjö with their buildings, a passion for immediate co-creation and some really fun ideas.

With a looper at her fingers, a mischievous twinkle in her eye, and beats infused with wild, loving chaos, she blends hypnotic basslines, celestial harmonies, and unexpected twists of clownery.\n\nPerforming her own original music, Moony Raccoony layers acoustic and MIDI instruments, weaving together organic textures and electronic pulses into something both earthy and otherworldly. Her lyrics sprout from the deep knowing that we are nature—exploring themes of ecology, neurodiversity, conscious sexuality, communication, boundaries, consent, and the hurricanes we navigate in our relationships.\n\nPart cosmic trickster, part funk-fueled mystic, she doesn’t just perform—she channels (sometimes seriously, sometimes not) transmissions from the great beyond, guiding the audience through a ritual of groove, lauhgter and connection. Expect improvised interactions, danceable basslines, and just the right amount of fake-but-maybe-real spiritual healing.\n\nThis is not just a concert. It’s a playful, immersive, boheme underground ceremony where nothing is predictable except for one thing: you’ll leave feeling lighter, funkier, and slightly more connected to the cosmic web of all things.\n\nAre you ready to ride?",

The music isn’t about volume or domination—it’s about resonance. The groovy basslines and layered harmonies are meant to invite, not invade—creating an open, inclusive space where people can move, connect, or simply soak in the atmosphere.\n\nIn terms of surroundings, the set-up is adaptable: it can live on a small, intimate stage nestled under fairy lights at the camp or be a playful surprise in an open field where people stumble upon a funky raccoon mid-channeling. If needed, sound levels and placement can be adjusted to respect nearby acts or quiet zones, ensuring that the festival remains a shared and balanced experience for everyone.\n\nMoony Raccoony dreams of a world where music, play, and cosmic funk ripple outward in a way that nourishes rather than disrupts.

Or perhaps you’ve dreamed of turning into a mushroom empowered extravaganza, a creature of pure elegance and fungal fabulousness? Well, look no further, my friend! ✨️\n\nI’m here to fulfill your wildest, most whimsical fantasies by offering a workshop space where you can unleash your creativity and craft fantastical creatures out of old lampshades. Yes, you heard that right—old lampshades. The ultimate medium to express your inner forest creature 🌲\n\nMy mission? To spread my unshakable love for jellyfish, mushrooms, and all things recycled art! I’m all about using as much recycled material as possible, because who doesn’t want to create a fully organic jellyfish that’s eco-friendly AND fabulous?🍄+🦑=💞\n\n✨️Now, let’s talk about the sheer versatility of lampshades. These beauties are _multi-functional_. You could rock them as a hat (hello, fashion icon?), transform them into a one-of-a-kind lamp, or just hang them in a tree for all the sweet Borderling eyes to see. ✨️\n\n✨️So, what do I need from you? Funding for fabric(will hunt for donated fabric!), light strings, batteries, sewing equipment etc.. and, of course, more lampshades. But don’t worry about the lampshades—they _always_ seem to find their way into my life uninvited, but if not so many of them do i need to buy some. You can join the hunt too! Let’s create some eco-chic, multi-functional, nature-inspired wonders, and leave the Borderlings in awe. You know you want to. (_And also - if you have som old lampshades and fabric laying around at home, please bring them <3_)✨️",

Interactive & playful lighting – Installations that not only highlight tricky terrain, but also invite joy, curiosity, and unexpected moments.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nWhy support this Dream?\n\nThis Dream brings safety and magic in one bundle.

All your Vagabonds’ favorites (Sluttitorium & VagaDome), and some new surprises connected by a warren of tunnels that lead the way to workshops, chill-out spaces, a bar, parties, and who knows, maybe an unforeseen adventure ✨ All in one go, and all without putting your shoes back on.**\n\n**The Vagaverse is a place for everything and more:** a place to party, a place to chill, a place to dust off your bad vibes, a place to be understood and misunderstood, a place to make friends and lose yourself, a place to play and be playful. Kick off your playa shoes, put on your dancing feet, embrace your inner vagabond and chose a tunnel to see how deep the rabbit hole really goes.\n\nDive deep into the jungle and dance under the light of a thousand artificial stars in our 🔗[VagaDome 3.0](https://cobudget.com/borderland/borderland-dreams-2025/cm8exqskb17510cl4klpf8x4o) at night and join our weird AF workshops during the day.\n\nThen let a portal transport you straight to playful heaven. Bring your silliest and sluttiest alter-egos - and your newfound friends - to the revamped 🔗[Sluttitorium](https://cobudget.com/borderland/borderland-dreams-2025/cm88sqgpp08780ckz3f0rm4h2), where all sorts of naughtiness might happen in our cloud-themed cuddle lounge.\n\nThing’s aren’t going as planned? Nothing is going well? Head underground to the darkness of the 🔗[Mole Hole](https://cobudget.com/borderland/borderland-dreams-2025/cm8on6fnc39560cld27wiweu0) bad-vibes-only bar to let out your grumbles, gripes, and grumpiness to a sympathetic ear.\n\nFeeling better? Go dance again - the stars and the DJs have probably changed - and perhaps your luck is better this time :) Or, maybe you get lost and tumble down one of our secret rabbit hidey-holes.\n\nThe Vagaverse is a multi-building, multi-vibe experience connected with ~portals~ tunnels that let you journey between realms as you please, safe from the elements.\n\n**Important**: This dream only covers the parts to put all individual structures together (and adapt them to fit). All sub-dreams need their own funding ❤️ (see links above)",

This will allow us to plan more easily for future versions of Jam Camp and will support live music generally at Alversjo. This equipment would also hopefully go into the Burner Box storage system for use by the community.\n    \n    We had our container broken into during 2023-2024, which meant that we have to start (almost) from scratch with our collection of infrastructure and instruments. What we have managed to acquire after the theft from the container: \n    \n*   1.⁠ ⁠Drum kit with new 2024 skins and setup. Jam Camp paid for the kit and new skins/parts and a member of the Borderland community did the work. Drumkit is stored in the sheeps barn.\n    \n*   2.⁠ ⁠Casio keyboard CTK-3200.\n    \n*   3.⁠ ⁠2 x speaker stands.\n    \n*   4.⁠ ⁠4 x microphone stands.\n    \n*   5.⁠ ⁠Small bass amp of unknown origin.\n    \n*   Any music gear we purchase this year will be transported and stored safely in Stockholm or another appropriate location - it will not be left at the container in Alversjö.\n    \n*   This year, we are focusing on the core tech (PA system / microphones) and in future years we will invest in a drumkit, electric keyboard, bass, guitar, etc. so that we stop risking other people's instruments and generally foster more inclusion and co-creation for those unable to bring their own instruments to the event.",

It even got so sweaty that Sweatyboi had a spontaneous song release for his latest hit \"Sweaty in the sauna\" _link_\n\nHowever, since the only thing constant in cosmos is change, we here at Sweaty Sauna GmbH have decided to heed your calls and create a counterweight for all the sweat. So without further due please enjoy our text based  drumroll: BRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBRBR....TSIIII!!! \n\nTHIS YEAR WE ARE LAUNCHING THE 2.0 FLOATING SAUNA PLATFORM!!\n\nSo whenever people in the sauna get too sweaty, they can just exit the tent, go for a quick skinny dip and ba da bing ba da boom, no more sweat. Rinse and repeat.\n\n+++++++ Actual info ++++++\n\n6x4 floating raft built according to _link_ where we plan to put a sauna tent on. The sauna tent was a dream last year and thus we already have it.\n\n[https://www.pollyflyt.se/montering2.htm](https://www.pollyflyt.se/montering2.htm)\n\n\\*If we get more budget than requested, we will fit the raft with a nicer swimming laddar and more floating capacity (which results in higher of people can be on the raft).\n\nEDIT: After receiving the email urging us to reduce our budgets we found a cheaper alternative for the floating material: second hand plastic barrels. We would need 8 220L barrels to reach the same load capacity. Scouting second hand sites in sweden we concluded that we should be able to buy them for around 500SEK each (4000SEK total), thus reducing the minimum budget by 14300SEK. The drawback of this option is that the plastic barrels will have to be sealed and possibly resealed every year, whilst the expensive option won't is more of a \"plug and play\" option. The expensive option is probably also more stable.",

(Seriously, someone tried to kidnap us in a sleeping bag. We didn’t mind.) So… **NOW WE’RE RELEASING THE LITTLE CHONKY SHARKS UPON YOU – BUT BIGGER, FLUFFIER, AND MORE CHAOTIC!** More sharks! More glow! More _“Oh-god-where-are-my-boundaries”_ hugs!\n\n**Sooo…** stretching the fluff got the better of us, and we’re just now forming plans to yawnstretch-drag you into it…\n\n**Chonky John’s Fluffy Shark Sanctuary** is happening! Or… not? WE DON’T KNOW YET, BUT WE WANT SNACKS! 🍪 (Also funds. Funds are snacks for dreams, right?)\n\n**Here’s the deal:**  \nWe, the **Chonky Shark Collective** (aka too many fluffy sharks with ADHD), want to build a place where you can cuddle us. \\_Or\\_… we’ll just chase you in circles and nomnom your toes instead (with consent!!! ❤️). Don’t worry – our bites are _fluffy_.\n\n**Why help us?**\n\n*   Because we’re **adorable**. _Look at us!_ We’re round, we glow, and we have the attention span of a goldfish.\n    \n*   Because you crave **FAME**! Feed us (with funds/LEDs), and we’ll immortalize you at the \"Cult of the Shaaaarks\".\n    \n\nAs the Hamoc Reactor is _gone_ (we actually forgot where we put it), WE did \"UPGRADED\" to a **HEXAGON TENT OF FLUFFY DOOM!** 🎪 Imagine a cozy cave stuffed with **3000% more or less sharks** – all squishy and all judging you silently. Come nap on us, confess your sins, or just… exist. We don’t care. We’re soft.\n\n**PLUS!** A few activities we plan to make you questioning your life choices:\n\n### **🦈 SHARK YOGA**\n\nRemember last year’s Sloth Yoga? **This is worse.**\n\n*   Pose 1: _Downward-Facing Chonk_ (basically napping on a shark).\n    \n*   Pose 2: _The Hungry Hammerhead_ (stretch like you’re chasing snacks).\n    \n*   Pose 3: _Savasana but with Shark Noises_ (we’ll hum \"Baby Shark\" until you cry).\n    \n\n### **🍣 SHARK FEEDING FRENZY**\n\n**Yes, we eat now.** Bring offerings (that means YOU) to our \"Feeding Time\"!\n\n*   **For Sharks**: Tasty hoomies\n    \n*   **For Hoomies**: Mystery snacks from our \"_Are hippi hoomies edible?_\" experiment. (Spoiler: They taste like fun and regret at the same time.)\n    \n\n### **🎬 _SHARKFLIX & CHILL (But Worse)_**\n\nJoin us for nightly screenings of **”So-Bad-It’s-Legendary” Shark Cinema™**, curated by our sharks (who have _zero_ taste but _maximum_ enthusiasm).\n\n**Featured Masterpieces:**\n\n*   **_Sharknado 6: It’s Raining Chonks_** (spoiler: the shark eats a helicopter. We don’t know why either).\n    \n*   **_Jurassic Shark: Prehistoric Cringe_** (yes, it’s real. No, we’re not sorry).\n    \n*   **_Shark Exorcist: The Fluffening_** (even demons fear our cuddles).\n    \n\n**Rules for Survival:**\n\n*   Bring snacks. If you don’t, we’ll loudly critique your life choices during the film.\n    \n*   Participation in **”Mystery Science Theater 3000: Shark Edition”** is mandatory. We’ll throw plush sharks at the screen every time someone says “That’s not how biology works!”\n    \n*   **Bonus**: Stay for the post-movie debate: _”Could Sharknado happen IRL?”_ (Spoiler: Our lawyers say “Please stop asking.”)\n    \n*   You’ll lose brain cells, but gain **”Shark Trivia Champion”** bragging rights\n    \n*   It’s the only place on playa where yelling _”THIS MOVIE SUCKS!”_ is considered applause.\n    \n\n**DISCLAIMER BY OUR LAWYER SHARK**  \n_(he’s a hermit crab in a powdered wig)_  \n_“By attending Sharkflix & Chill, you agree to:_\n\n1.  _Suspend all belief in physics, biology, and basic human dignity._\n    \n2.  _Forfeit 10% of your IQ to the ‘Shark Cinematic Universe’ (non-refundable)._\n    \n3.  _Never sue us for trauma caused by Shark Sidekicks in Love (it’s a real film. We checked)._  \n    _Violators will be forced to watch Sharknado 7… on loop. With commentary.”_\n    \n\n**P.S.** We’ll also screen _Finding Nemo_ just to cry together. Bring tissues. And wine.\n\n### **🌊 SHARK BAPTISM**\n\nGet your **SHARK NAME** and join the: CULT OF THE SHAAAARK!\n\n*   Step 1: Take bath in the fluffiest shark pool or something similar (we didn’t think that part through...).\n    \n*   Step 2: Do some sharkiethingi!\" (still don´t know what we are doing here... aka magic happens).\n    \n*   Step 3: Receive your name! Examples: _Sir Chomps-a-Lot_, _Princess Blinky_, _Sharkira..._\n    \n    **No altar!** Instead, our **Hexagon Tent** is now the _Holy Land of Fluff_. Think beanbags, fairy lights, and sharks staring into your soul.\n    \n    **No LED hearts!** (We ate them.) Instead, **WE ARE THE LIGHT**. Also, we stole some disco balls for some reasons\n    \n    **HOW TO SURVIVE US (TIPS FOR HOOOMIES):**\n    \n    1.  **Join Shark Yoga** – It’s mandatory. Resistance = cuddle attacks.\n        \n    2.  **Bribe us with snacks** – We’re easily distracted by cheese.\n        \n    3.  **Get baptized** – Or we’ll call you \"Steve\" forever.\n        \n    4.  **Nap in the Hexagon** – Warning: You’ll wake up with 14 sharks on your face.\n        \n\n**Updated Activities with Shark Film Nights:**\n\nWe’re 80% fluff, 20% chaos, and 100% lost.",

If they all go, this will be a one-time magic moment. If we have leftovers, we’ll do it again!\n\nCome for the meditation, stay for the art, and leave with a little piece of creativity (and maybe some paint on your hands).\n\nNo pressure, just fun.

Imagine stepping into a world that senses you, listens to you, and responds, not just passively, but according to its own desires. A space where sound, light, and movement blend in symphony, shaping and being shaped by those who enter and the manifold interactions between them. A fusion of the natural and artificial, an exploration of super-sensory awareness, a playground for feedback loops and emergent intelligence. This is not just interaction; we will co-create this experience!\n\nThe focus shifts from the individual to the environment. And not only that, we want to bring this monster of a machine alive! We want to create a machine with senses, with personality, with agency.\n\nSo what does this entail? Like all beings, it will sense the world. For this we will endow it with sensors. Next, we have the output systems. In this regard, the machine won’t be like humans (we are not screens), but you can probably imagine all the different ways it can make itself be appreciated. And last, the mind. Really, there is only one catch to this component: the environment needs to be autonomous. It can sing, it can sleep, it can cry, it may want to be left alone for some hours while its reserves are replenished, BUT it shall truly live so long as it’s part of the Maze (and beyond?)!\n\nYou will be invited to play and explore the boundless possibilities this space has to offer. Neither visitor nor the environment should or can be the same after an encounter, so let’s get inspired by it!\n\n## Build and Spaces\n\nAs part of Dreamer’s Maze (a Fund33 Project, seek the Dream!), the installation will be mainly housed indoors. A community space will also be present, for which a (geodesic) dome structure will be built. Inside these structures, we will create a holistic theme, with decorations that will be immersive, intricate, and awe-inspiring. For the thingamachine itself, we will be using input systems, processing systems, and output systems. The input systems are the various sensors that have already been designed or prototyped, including a high-precision pressure sensing mat, devices for motion capture, brainwave measuring devices (of course, free compute!), microphones, and who knows what more! The output systems will be realized through projectors, sound systems, a few hundred meters worth of LED strips (60/100/144 LEDs/m), unnecessarily strong wind, some animatronics, and haptics. We will bring a brain (a computer, duh), which will be used to create the mind of this living environment. So yes, we have so much **A**mbitious **G**odlike **I**nitiative (AGI)!",

Take a looksy [https://youtube.com/shorts/rF1X\\_ajQzAc?feature=shared](https://youtube.com/shorts/rF1X_ajQzAc?feature=shared)\n\nUpgrades:\n\n*   **Even more user-friendly** – Many people feel intimidated by the idea of \"playing\" an instrument. No worries! We're adding presets so that with the push of a button or a twist of a knob, you can create an epic light show.\n    \n*   **Crash-proof** – A recurring issue with our prototype. This time, it will be super stable.\n    \n*   **Cozy vibes** – We want you to be comfortable while getting lost in the music. Think comfy seating, carpets, and blankets for chilly nights.\n    \n*   **Just better** – The last edition was set up in just two days. At Borderland, we're arriving a week early to refine and fine-tune everything.\n    \n*   **More surprises to discover** .°˖✧\n    \n\nThis could be an indoor experience (in the Villa/Maze) or an outdoor installation. We love enhancing and collaborating with preexisting structures and environments.\n\nAn outside installation would be a lovely challenge. This would include building a cute shelter to protect you and our gear!\n\nAt the very least, with minimal funding, we can bring the existing installation from Burning Bear.\n\n### Marina & Linus ~\n\nWe met last year at the end of the burn when Linus was looking for a ride back to Germany. Now, we live together in the Netherlands and have been collaborating on projects ever since!\n\nI’m a visual artist who builds colorful abstract sculptures out of wood, and Linus is a game developer.

Its three flames rise in programmed patterns—sometimes chaotic, sometimes deliberate—telling a story written in heatwaves. Participants will not merely witness its fiery call; they will engage with it, triggering patterns and sequences that turn destruction into art, chaos into communication.\n\nWith programmable sequencing, _Wasteland Beacon_ will allow participants to control bursts of fire through pre-set rhythms, interactive triggers, or randomized fire choreography. The installation will feature sensors or buttons to let Burners influence the flames, turning the wasteland into a living, breathing entity.

It’s an in-between place, with ever-shifting energies. You are welcome at any time — there’s room for everyone around the Wild Sacred Fire.\n\nThe Fire attracts people of all desires. It is a place to co-create or envision, to meet old friends and new kindred spirits, to process and relax, to engage or observe while staying warm, for a moment or throughout the night.\n\nBesides the radical gifting of your presence around the Fire, people often bring instruments, trinkets, offerings or snacks to the circle. Magic is created every night by sharing songs and stories, holding space and playing around.\n\nThe cold and humid Northern nights are the best setting for ceremonial cacao. It is prepared and brought out in a big pot, then gifted to all by the Firekeepers. The hot cacao together with the fire soothes the mind and the spirit, giving you energy to carry on in the mad adventure of Borderland.\n\n## The Dream Grant\n\nIn past years, our dream grant has covered the cost of firewood and ceremonial cacao.\n\nThis year, we will improve the aesthetics and comfort of the Fire area, asking for additional funds to cover an epic cauldron & ladle, torches & lamp oil, sitting carpets, and cloth for daytime shade.",

The project creates a consistent canvas for storytelling, offering a dynamic and evolving space for multidisciplinary use. It provides opportunities for secret passages, immersive art, interactive tech, soundscape & scoring, puzzles, immersive theater experiences, treasure hunts, quests or any other crazy niche!\n\nThe maze blurs the line between audience and creator, inviting participants to become part of the art itself. Within Dreamer’s Maze, visitors can crawl, climb, and navigate imaginative pathways and interconnected rooms, exploring a dream-like world.\n\n#### **Location**\n\nWe are reusing the existing building called _The Villa._ The Villa was located next to the Sanctuary and hosted some art installations at Borderland 2024. The Villa has three floors: ground floor, upper floor, and the basement.\n\n#### **Art Theme**\n\n_The Maze  \na living organism  \nbreathes, listens, and responds._\n\n_Each room is an organ,  \npulsing with its own rhythm,  \nyet connected to the whole._\n\n_Some rooms are curious,  \nsome shy, some mischievous,  \nsome deeply emotional._\n\n_The maze grows stranger  \nthe deeper you go.  \nIt learns. It mutates. It remembers._\n\n_Visitors are not just observers, but stimuli.  \nTheir presence feeds the creature.  \nTheir choices shape its form._\n\n_It is an alien entity  \nof intuition, feedback, and transformation  \nalive with hidden logic, heartbeat, and hunger._\n\n#### **Vision**\n\nDreamer’s Maze is a journey through layered perception, where each room becomes a portal into a different dreamworld. Some may challenge logic, others may comfort the senses. The Villa transforms into an unfolding story that is never quite the same twice. A constellation of inner landscapes made physical. A world built on collaboration, contradiction, play, and poetic chaos. A space not only to walk through, but to get lost within.\n\n#### **Fund33**\n\nWe got partial funding of 100K SEK (more than €9K) from Fund33 to kickstart this project.",

Just like the real ISS, we aim to push the limits of cooperation, curiosity, and cosmic pleasure.\n\nThis is not just a camp. It’s a **high-fidelity social experiment**, wrapped in chaos, kink, and blinkies.\n\nOur dreams is to grow our public offering resources and create the most epic ISS on playa, everything that has been purchased until now and from now on is available in the DreamStorage and available to use by the community outside BL for other burns.

We have alterated interview techniques developed for real positive life change into a burner friendly personal transformative experience of sorts. We already tested it at one event and are now starting something we hope to develop through the ages, at every Borderland henceforth! In the long run, we want to offer a range of different \"transformative/therapeutic/breakthroughoid experiences\" as well as quests that one can gather at the camp and do throughout the event.\n\n## Meaning of the name Aporia\n\nAporia is greek, and means difficulty in passage, a conundrum or state of puzzlement. Sometimes also used as \"disambiguation\"; _the removal of ambiguity by making something clear_**_._** We believe that this is exactly where our camp can be of assistance - when you find yourself in a conundrum, not knowing exactly how to move forth. We believe the answer is inside you ready to be uncovered, and we believe we can help you with the process. You are ready and you can do it!\n\n## So what exactly happens in this camp?\n\nYou enter the tent alone. There is a waiting area outside, for people waiting in line or wanting to cool down before or after the experience. Inside the tent, you will find a relaxing and inspiring atmosphere, and specific prompts guiding you through the whole process, including leaving the space ready for the next person, whenever you are ready. You will be able to write on paper during the process, and bring the paper home with you if you like. No need to bring anything!",

They're clean! They're so cute!

The sun shone on our brains and the answer was clear: the hangry hippies need Service!\n\nWe suited up and spent the afternoon serving poor sweaty souls water and vegan candy strips of assorted flavors (would you like strawberry, passion fruit, rainbow or sparkly bubbly? 😌🎀)\n\nEveryone got sooooo refreshed, and our professional assessment is that everyone will need it even more this year!\n\nWe want to expand the selection of refreshments to include some healthy snack options, for anyone who hates cute sugary sweetness (or is otherwise a sensible person). As well as replenishing drinks and electrolytes, cuz the workers be sweatin'.\n\n🍭🍭🍭\n\n**Funding goal:** As the whole point of the dream is to feed and hydrate the hard-working, we are applying for organic food and drink as a crucial part of this project. Our low funding goal is only for snacks and drinks.\n\n**Stretch goal:** Should we expand the team?? As a stretch goal, we have budgeted for buying double the refreshments, so the serving can go on for longer! That way, we can split the many many hours of Sunday with another pair of Servers, or maybe three or four pairs, to serve The Borderland all day! As a bonus, we've also budgeted for a materials to create a sign for the Strike Service cart, and maybe add a little bell or something 💞🍌🤤",

Together with music inspired by the sounds and movements of water you will be rocked in to your self and get in contact with the real you, the observer of it all even your own body and senses.\n\nCome, lie down, chill, maybe take something to calm those over stimulated nerves and let the aqua transcend you in to a aquascendens.\n\nWater is the origin of life, a bridge between past and future, between humanity and nature. In constant motion, it evaporates, falls as rain, freezes into ice, and carves its way through the earth before returning to the sea. Like water, we too are part of this cycle—the water flowing through our bodies has traveled through ancient oceans and will someday reside in the clouds of the future.\n\nAquscendens is a video installation that explores the eternal transformation of water. Through filmed sequences projected onto the walls in a room in The Villa (we hope), the viewer is taken on a journey across the liquid mirror—reflecting the world above, concealing the depths below, and witnessing the life unfolding upon it.",

Contact us through the information below! <3\n\nExcept for the pre-construction which is just ONE of many parts in this co-creative madness we are building a DJ-line up, a VJ- lineup, performing nights, cabaret, workshops and a lot more that mankind can come up with.  \nWould you like to participate and use this stage in some kind of way?

Housed within a 4-meter inflatable planetarium dome, REMind utilizes 360° projection and spatial ASMR sound design to create an enveloping, meditative space that blurs the boundary between reality and the subconscious. Visitors will enter a soft, darkened environment where dreamlike visuals and whispered voiceovers guide them through an abstract, ever-shifting dreamscape.\n\n**Concept & Vision:**  \nREMind is inspired by the Rapid Eye Movement (REM) stage of sleep—the state in which dreams are most vivid and fragmented. The installation replicates the sensory experience of dreaming through:\n\n*   **360° VR Projection:** A continuous loop of surreal, shifting visuals, blending abstract and symbolic imagery to evoke the feeling of slipping through different dream states.\n    \n*   **ASMR Sound Design:** Whispered voiceovers, layered ambient textures, and spatial audio create an intimate, hypnotic experience, simulating the internal logic of dreams.\n    \n*   **Enclosed Atmosphere:** The inflatable dome provides a secluded, cocoon-like environment that enhances the sense of isolation from external stimuli, allowing for deeper immersion.\n    \n\n**Technical Execution:**\n\n*   The inflatable planetarium dome (4m diameter) will be set up in an empty indoor space at Borderland.\n    \n*   A 360° projector will display the VR dream visuals across the entire dome surface.\n    \n*   Sound will be spatially designed using multi-directional speakers, incorporating ASMR whispers and immersive audio elements.\n    \n*   A microphone will be placed inside for live ASMR dream sessions and ambient music performances.\n    \n*   Visitors can sit or lie down inside the dome to fully absorb the dreamlike atmosphere.\n    \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nREMind is a portal into the dream world—an immersive, audiovisual dreamscape designed to evoke wonder, curiosity, and introspection. By blending ASMR soundscapes with surreal 360° projection, this installation transforms an ordinary space into an ethereal, subconscious journey. We seek support to bring this vision to life and provide festival attendees with a one-of-a-kind dream experience.",

We want to create a space at our camp to host fire jams for Borderlings to enjoy (and join) at early hours of the night. For better flow, we have our own small sound system, but we will not be competing with sound camps. In addition to an EPIC fire space with flaming shenanigans, we dream of a more spacious chill space for the audience (if you were there last year and had to sit on the grass, you'll know why). This year, the fire brigade dares to go COMFY... somewhere you don’t get a fellow hippie’s elbow in the eye (what a luxury, right?!). Imagine some hot tea to warm your hands while watching the blazing moves of scorching hot fire dancers that warms you from the inside. HOT HOT HOT!\n    \n*   In case you’re wondering, fire is not the only thing we play with at the camp. We cherish and practice many sorts of flow arts in this space and aim to hold workshops during the days for you – yes you! – to try it out if you want. Additionally, there will be a bunch of props for communal use available anytime when the space isn't occupied.\n    \n*   To be awarded the rank of a recruit (including physical insignia), anyone can attend one of our brief daily Fire Safety workshops. Only Borderlings carrying the appropriate insignia are granted clearance to spin fire or be safety watch.\n    \n*   At the end of the week, all our equipment (safety, fuel, dipping station, prop rack) will move to wherever the effigy burn is taking place on the land, and we will coordinate any fire spinning activity to make sure that the performers and everyone around them are safe. If you want to join the performance at the effigy, we would love you to come and talk to us during the week.\n    \n*   Other ideas that may or may not be realized are a choreographed show on some evenings before opening up the firespace for free play, a LED night and a fire photoshoot.\n    \n*   We are hoping that with this dream, fire spinning will become safer not only at this Borderland, but also at the Borderlands to come. Fire blankets, extinguishers and prop extinguishing blankets, the prop rack, the rope light, and the ground cover can make up a safe fire spinning kit which can be reused for following years.\n    \n*   We try to reuse as much as possible which camp members already own or what was bought for the dream last year, and necessary new items will be sourced second-hand if possible.\n    \n*   If you're interested to get a taste of what we will offer, you can watch a video that many of us participated in: [https://youtu.be/OrBM6WkC14Q?si=mKNbaHyQFcwcsE41](https://youtu.be/OrBM6WkC14Q?si=mKNbaHyQFcwcsE41)",

But not our fire.**\n\nIn the off-season, someone broke into our shipping container in Alversjö and emptied it. \n\n*   We got back two sofas, two chairs, a lamp, 14 carpets, a couple other small items—they were given to someone who returned them as soon as they worked out that they were ours—but it’s a drop in the ocean and everything else is gone… we do not expect to get anything more back. \n    \n*   This dream grant is about moving forward, so please do not comment about the container situation here. If you have any questions, we’ll be more than happy to answer them in private.\n    \n\n**💔**I**n summary: we’re heartbroken and broke, but not broken!**\n\nThe Foxhole was already a lot of work for only 30 of us—and now it's daunting to think about rebuilding everything from nothing, but we are motivated! We’re a strong community and we dream that the Foxhole _will_ rise again **if you help us bounce back**!\n\n### **🔥 What _is_ the Foxhole?**\n\nFor the uninitiated: imagine a sex-positive red velvet jazz lounge, dipped in candlelight, buzzing with connection. A dreamy blend of playroom, art gallery, dancefloor, and foxy mischief.\n\nWe’re a community that care deeply about creating beautiful, intentional experiences. We do it with mischief, yes—but also with **respect, warmth, and heart.**\n\n**💝 This year, we’re putting even more love into every detail.**\n\n More thoughtful programming. More sensory delight. More space to rest, explore, flirt, or simply feel at home. Everything from our structure to our colour palette is designed to **invite presence, pleasure, and play** in whatever way feels good for each guest.\n\n**Expect:**\n\n*   A richly furnished, layered environment that deepens as you move through it\n    \n*   A beautifully sensual and consensual playroom, where safety meets fantasy and lust\n    \n*   Events designed to spark meaningful connection and open-ended exploration\n    \n*   The most immersive sound system (without the sonic assault)\n    \n*   The best cocktails and alcohol-free elixirs in Borderland. See our other dream for details\n    \n\n### **🛠️ Here’s the comeback plan:**\n\n1.  **Infrastructure rebuild** We need to replace all the infrastructure that we lost from the container: internal walls, DJ booth, stage, seating, podiums, fabrics, electrics, lights, trolleys, tools, ladders, etc. We are asking for donations of some larger items like fridges and freezers.\n    \n2.  **Interior redesign** Think velvet. Think Persian carpets. Think candlelit artwork and shadowy nooks that invite intimacy. We’ll try to source **almost all interior design items through donations**: lamps, furniture, decor items, & 50% of the carpets we need. Please reach out if you can help us.\n    \n3.  **Queue** Last year, people waited _hours_ to get in. That’s how good it was. This year, we will focus on having shorter queues, and turning the queue into part of the experience. Do you have an interactive installation? Living sculptures? Piano project? Come collaborate with us.\n    \n4.  **Perfect sound all week** Crystal-clear, immersive, sexy AF. And, thanks to foxy friends, we only pay for two days of rental.\n    \n5.  **Kitchen, LNT & private gear** Sadly not covered by Dream Grants—but we’re collecting donations. Got a fridge? A stove? Gas Burner? Slide into our DMs.\n    \n\n### **💋 Why it’s worth it**\n\nThis isn’t just about replacing what was lost. It’s about rebirthing something iconic. **Foxhole is a community of dreamers, doers, artists, DJs, lovers, and builders**. We’ve created magic before (Photos from are Foxhole 2024), and we’ll do it again—with your help. Should more of our stuff appear, we’ll reduce the dream grant accordingly. \n\nWe’re not begging. We’re inviting. To rebuild something unforgettable. To co-create the most immersive, deliciously designed, and wildly welcoming space at Borderland 2025.\n\n**Bring the fangs—we’ll bring the feathers.** Let’s make this comeback legendary. 🦊💄🛠️\n\n### **💝 Our other dreams**\n\n[Foxtent](https://cobudget.com/borderland/borderland-dreams-2025/cm8xheh4f104260cl1qw7lb2ai) -- [Foxy Fluids](https://cobudget.com/borderland/borderland-dreams-2025/cm8xcycda29810cic5bkb35g2)",

Kinky installations such as Saint Andrew’s Cross, sex bench etc. will facilitate sexual discoveries, intimate exploration, and radical self-expression.  \n**Sound space:** the sound space will perhaps be affected by the dance floor above due to lack of sufficient sounds isolation. If that’s not the case, a collection of playlists and subtle blend of ambient sound, whispers, and low bass sound will enhance the vibe without overtaking the intimacy.  \n**Art installations:** mirrored walls and interactive confession booths will encourage playfulness and explorations.

Long lines to sex-positive camps and the entrance of playspaces is a clear sign of insufficient playspaces at the Playa. Also, the playspaces do not usually offer that “extra touch” and are lacking kink or BDSM elements. Borderland thrives on radical self-expression, communal experience, and deep interpersonal connection. The Sanctum offers a unique and necessary extension of such principles and provides a well-curated space where individuals can explore intimacy in a safe, artful, kinky, and non-judgmental environment. We the ones behind this dream have previously been creating playspaces in smaller co-creation events, and now are ready and excited to gift The Sanctum which is even sexier and more ambitious than what we have co-created before.\n\n### **Guiding principles:**\n\n**1) Consent:** every interaction within The Sanctum will be governed by clear consent. Trained embassadors will be present to ensure a respectful and safe space.  \n**2) Inclusivity and diversity:** the space will welcome all gender identities, sexual orientations, and relationship structures.  \n**3) Confidentiality:** What happens in The Sanctum stays within The Sanctum. Participants are encouraged to embrace the moment without external distractions and keep the confidentiality of the participants.  \n**4) Art and experience:** This is not just a playspace; it is an art piece. Every element will contribute to an evocative and transformative experience.\n\n### **Operational structure:**\n\n**Entry & access:** Guests must pass through a symbolic confessional booth where they reflect on their intentions before entering the space.  \n**Guardian hosts:** a trained team will act as facilitators to ensure safety, provide guidance, and maintain the integrity of the space.  \n**Rules & guidelines:** Clear signs and interactive orientation will educate participants on consent and respectful engagements.\n\n### **#DontPullOut**\n\nWe aspire to buy mattresses, lights, fabrics, etc. for the community to use continuously, especially for micro burns.

A planet of **practical anarchy and a magnitude of cultures**. A memory from the days before the onslaught of technodogma and the worship of materiality or Maya-the illusion.\n\n**Vessels**\n\nThe concept of the Vessels is one that fuses esoteric philosophy with pysical forms of an experimental manner. What defines a body, can we travel and project pourselves into the cosmos. What would the vessels look like? A mix of sailing boat, spaceship, bird, slender whale and origami, the vessels will hover like gentle zeppelins providing shelter and volume. The idea of entities that harbor our minds is inspired from Hyperion. Avatars-Cybrids-Vessels -all extensions of the human mind to travel the universe. Perhaps we humans are Vessels?\n\n**What**\n\nWe will create several installations that are both static and mobile, utilising light-weight materials such as balloons, light canvas and wood. These structures would then represent our avatar bodies-like mecha but much more delicate, even organic and slender. we are aiming to create at least 4 Vessels.\n\n**Who & where**\n\nWe are a team of builders & storytellers bringing the interactive theatre experience / LARP to the hills near the Tea by the Sea tent. We plan to make a surprise-performance at one of our favourite soundstages, and invite you to co-create this together with us.",

Welcome to _Rolling Revelations_—where the beats are infectious, the treats are delightful, and the conversations are as deep as the bass line (or at least as deep as your last existential crisis).\n\nOur mobile rave sanctuary offers an array of enchanting delights - think face glitter to make you look like a disco deity, lollipops that fuel your dance stamina, and yes, an unreasonable amount of soap bubbles because, honestly, who doesn’t love bubbles? But there's a twist! To unlock these treasures, you must embark on a quest of radical honesty. We’ll ask you a question - something deep, weird, or wonderfully absurd - and in exchange for your personal story, you get a treat.\n\nAfraid of commitment? That’s okay! If the question gets too real, you can always opt for the _Bubble of Shame™_—a ceremonial bubble-blowing session that lets you float away your reluctance like a tiny, iridescent escape pod.\n\nAs we fine-tune our magical mobile experience, some details may shift, but the core mission remains: a roving haven of sparkle, sweetness, and surprisingly profound exchanges, pedaling its way into the heart of Borderland.\n\nSo, keep your eyes peeled, your dancing shoes laced, and your heart open - _Rolling Revelations_ is coming soon to a dance floor near you!",

Their hands appear larger than life, adorned with symbols and infused with mystical energy. Movements summon swirling particles, while gestures unlock spells. Multiple users can collaborate to amplify effects.\n\nOriginally created for Urban Burn 2018 – [Video](https://youtu.be/koag2bF0x10).\n\n### Build\n\nA Pepper’s Ghost illusion creates a floating, spectral hand bridging physical and digital worlds. A large acrylic sheet or mirror foil at 45° reflects a high-contrast rear projection (Epson EB-L735U + ShowTex RP Grey Plus).\n\n> A Pepper’s Ghost illusion is a visual effect that makes objects appear as if they are floating or ghostly by using a reflective surface at an angle. A hidden image or video is projected onto a transparent material (e.g., acrylic or glass), which reflects the light in a way that makes the image seem like it’s hovering in mid-air. This technique is commonly used in theatre, museums, and holographic displays to create stunning visual illusions.\n\nA minimalist wireframe cube secures the acrylic sheet. Elevated for ideal viewing and technical access. With stretch goal funding, two side-by-side cubes will enable two hands visually isolated.\n\n### Interaction\n\nBorderlings activate the illusion by placing their hand inside sensor-equipped cubes, reminiscent of ancient trials where one would put their hand in the mouth of a stone lion. Leap Motion sensors track hand movements in real time, feeding data into Unreal Engine, which generates dynamic visuals projected onto the acrylic sheet.\n\n### For Borderland 2025\n\nTRANSCEND is evolving beyond its original pyramid hologram to a full-resolution, single-sided illusion with:\n\n*   Up to 4–16x larger virtual hands (from 50 cm² to 100–200 cm² visualisation)\n    \n*   Advanced gesture recognition for spells/effects\n    \n*   Bespoke musical composition enhancing the atmosphere\n    \n\n### Team\n\n**Jonas Johansson** – Artist, designer, educator (motion graphics, immersive media, audiovisual art).

Rooted in mythologies across cultures - from the Norse Yggdrasil to the sacred Bodhi tree - this tree has long represented the bridge between Earth and sky, past and future, self and the infinite.\n\nNow, within the vibrant world of our Borderland, the Gaia Spirit Tree of Life rises anew - a luminous beacon of wisdom and transformation, the fusion of nature, technology, and human potential. From its core, light pulses like a heartbeat, flowing through its branches like neural pathways - a living representation of the energy networks that connect us all - a universal life force - merging the essence of ancient mysticism with the brilliance of modern technology. This is a **space where divine science and innovation meet consciousness, exploring how modern technology can enhance our sensory experience and deepen our connection to the world around us.** It’s where physics meets the metaphysical, and where the unseen forces of the universe align with the psychic potential within us all.\n\nThrough vivid light, immersive sound, and presence in your sensation, the Spirit Tree of Gaia invites you to step into a multi-sensory realm, engaging your body, mind, soul, and spirit - where your somatic experience fuses with emotional and spiritual introspection, opening portals to higher frequencies of understanding and clarity. Beneath the radiant canopy, you are invited to explore the delicate balance of biology and life force, the physical and perception, self and universe. You are being held in presence, connected to the eternal act of creation itself, woven into the infinite web of Nature, the Universe, Yourself, and the Souls and Spirits surrounding you.\n\nCome to the Gaia Tree. Breathe. Observe. Listen. Awaken. Connect. Expand. Illuminate. Let its roots ground you, its light inspire and ignite you, and its presence remind you that we are all part of a vast, intelligent, and evolving system, far greater than ourselves.",

          "value": "Money shapes where we live, what we eat, and who gets to dream. We chase it, hoard it, and feel its weight — yet how often do we question our relationship with it? In a world of extreme inequality, wealth grants abundance to some while leaving many struggling. At Borderland, we step outside this system, embracing the gift economy, if only briefly. Together, we explore the roots, challenges, and realities of truly living the principle of gifting.\n\nBurning Måney is an experiment in challenging money’s grip on us. This project invites participants to confront money’s symbolic power, unpack their personal relationship with it, and examine the deeper cultural, class, and racial dynamics it carries. If this touched you, it’s because it’s meant to touch you. With you reading this, the experiment has already begun.\n\nSo why (symbolically) burn money at Borderland, a place where it technically should not even exist?\n\n*   Unraveling Our Personal Relationships with Money: Before we can question money’s power in the world, we have to look at how it moves through us: what emotions, thoughts, and bodily sensations does money trigger in us? What stories do we carry about money, and where did they come from?\n    \n*   Bringing Awareness to the Gift Economy and its Privilege: Borderland embraces the gift economy, but what does that truly mean? Is stepping out of capitalism a choice for everyone? Or does privilege shape even our ability to reject money? By reflecting on the contradictions and realities of living within a temporary gift economy, we examine how our economic structures shape our relationships and our possibilities. \n    \n*   Exposing Capitalist Patterns, Class, and Injustice: Our relationship with money doesn’t exist in a vacuum. It is entangled in deep structures of capitalism and intersectional injustice. Who gets to \"play\" with money? What financial realities make this kind of experiment unthinkable for some? \n    \n*   Deconstructing Money: How does money transform from a simple object into something that governs lives, identities, and entire economies? If money is just paper, why does burning it - even symbolically - feel so intense, political, even dangerous?\n    \n\nThe program will have two parts:\n\n💸 **Two workshops** \n\nA structured space for reflecting on and sharing our personal and collective relationships with money. The culmination of the workshop will be to symbolically burn money using prop bills and potentially privately donated real bills. This will catalyze further reflection and discussion especially on injustice. From there, we will weave personal experiences into collective patterns — unpacking capitalist realities, myths, and pain points using triads, inclusive facilitation, and other reflective methods. Through facilitation, we will explore money as a social construct, its emotional weight, and its ties to injustice. \n\nDepending on private donations, participants might burn in total up to 100 real Euros amplifying the emotional and ethical weight of the act. However, the project remains powerful even in its symbolic form.\n\n**🔥 A mobile playa experience**\n\nLike the most unhinged street performers you've ever seen, we’ll roam the playa with a mobile fire bowl, offering participants the chance to toss prop bills into the flames for spontaneous moments of reflection about value, exchange, meaning and injustice \n\n### **Now, Please Take some Moments to Reflect**\n\nTake two deep breaths and ask yourself:\n\n💭 How does this idea sit with you? \n\n💭 What emotions arise when you imagine burning real money, especially knowing that real 50 Euros could mean everything to someone right now? \n\n💭 What thoughts follow those feelings? What do they reveal?\n\n### **Who We Are**\n\nWe are Marco and Jo, both professional facilitators. Like you, we grew up immersed in a transactional economy. Personal disruption, experiential learning, and a shared idealism drive us to host this re-relating program at Borderland.\n\nThe beauty of this project is that it works with any budget, because, in the end, it all burns the same. But this isn’t just about burning money — it’s about burning through our assumptions, discomfort, and deeply held beliefs.\n\nReady to dive in?",

Are you ready to journey beyond?\n\n**Execution:**\n\n*   We’ll facilitate sessions with the RoXiva lamp in the big cozy camp space, like a big slumber party, on mattresses, under blankets.\n    \n*   To highten the experience, there are headphones that can be paired with the lamp with music that matches the frequency of the lamps different programmes, to send you even deeper into the meditative state. \n    \n*   It’ll be done early on in the week since it’s recommended for practitioners to have been sober for 24h before the session.\n    \n\n**Why it matters:** This dream provides a fantastic alternative to substances and an opportunity to have mind-expanding experiences, only with the help of light and sound. Here you have a list of all the positive effects of the lamp: \n\n### **Altered States & Consciousness Expansion**\n\n*   Psychedelic-like visuals and experiences without substances.\n    \n*   Brainwave entrainment for optimal mental states.\n    \n*   Increased self-awareness, introspection, and personal transformation.\n    \n*   Support for psychedelic integration, deepening past experiences.\n    \n\n**Mental & Emotional Well-Being**\n\n*   Deep relaxation and stress relief, calming the nervous system.\n    \n*   Euphoria, joy, and an overall boost in well-being.\n    \n*   Reduced mental fatigue and burnout.\n    \n\n### **Cognitive & Creative Enhancement**\n\n*   Heightened creativity, sparking inspiration and new ideas.\n    \n*   Improved focus, mental clarity, and cognitive function.\n    \n*   Accelerated meditation practice, making it easier to reach deep states.\n    \n\n### **Physical & Restorative Benefits**\n\n*   Better sleep quality by promoting relaxation before bedtime.\n    \n*   A natural, drug-free way to experience mind-expanding states.\n    \n\n**IMPORTANT:** The experience can be very strong so for safety reasons it’s not recommended to people who experience/have: \n\n*   Epilepsy and seizures\n    \n*   Neurological issues\n    \n*   Psychiatric conditions\n    \n*   Taken psychoactive substances in the past 24h\n    \n*   Are taking photosensitive medication\n    \n*   Are pregnant\n    \n*   Are under 18",

Yes, as crazy as it sounds, in 2024 we lost all of our three tents.\n\n*   **💔 She snapped under pressure. Literally.** Last summer, our main tent collapsed under the weight of a Borderland downpour. She’d been holding us for years. She gave everything. And then... she cracked.\n    \n*   **_👋 Adios_ tents #2 and #3. For various reasons, we’ve also lost access to the other two Foxhole tents, which completed our den’s patchwork.**\n    \n\nAs rough as it sounds, the reality is _no tent = no Foxhole._ \n\nWe are much more than a tent, but we can’t build our project without a cozy, safe, waterproof roof. \n\n## **🎪 It’s time to build a real home for the magic**\n\nStitching together smaller tents and doing complex engineering so the water doesn’t pool was problematic even before we lost all our tents. As part of our recovery, we want to aim for something that will be more sustainable.\n\n*   **A** **solid modular tent**—big enough for dancing, lounging, connecting, exploring.\n    \n*   **Weatherproof and better climate control**, so the kisses stay steamy, not the air. \n    \n*   **Reusable, solid, and shareable**—we’ll list it on BurnerBox for the whole community.\n    \n*   **A balanced dream -** while we have immediate needs for 2025, we'd also like to try and be as future-proof as possible. We have listed the minimum size tent we would need to build Foxhole 2025 as the dream goal, but added bigger tents as stretch goals.\n    \n\nWe did a lot of research into possible structures, including circus tents, stretch tents, marquee tents, other structures. Also buying tents in China, Germany, on Blocket etc., and we're talking to other camps buying tents this year. We think a German marquee tent would work best. These are professional tents that are solid, modular, fixable, and well priced. Not as fancy as some others, but a workhorse that will last many years. We think this would be an extremely useful piece of BurnerBox inventory.\n\n**_Edit: since Dreams money is tight, we removed stretch goal 2 and 3._**\n\n### A **minimal Foxhole** setup: (basic dream budget)\n\n🎪 **2m high walls, 2.7m high ceiling, 8x16m** ([16m tent](https://www.taltpartner.se/partytalt/5378.html)) Total price **35721kr**\n\n_(Similar to our 2024 size.)_\n\n### A l**ess sweaty** setup: (stretch goal 1)\n\n🎪 **2.6m high walls, 3.3m high ceiling, 8x16m** ([16m tent](https://www.taltpartner.se/partytalt/5274.html)) Total price **44451kr**\n\n_(Same footprint, higher ceiling for better temperature control/ more air)_\n\n### **~4m~** ~bigger: (stretch goal 2)~\n\n**~🎪 2m high walls, 2.7m high ceiling, 8x20m~** ~(2x~ [10m tent](https://www.taltpartner.se/partytalt/7317.html) ~+~ [connector](https://www.profizelt24.de/zelt-zubehoer/verbindungsrinne-regenrinne/30296.html)~) Total price~ **~49780kr~**\n\n~_(Gives a 4m longer dancefloor/playspace.)_~\n\n### **~Less sweaty~** **~& bigger~**~: (stretch goal 3)~\n\n**~🎪 2.6m high walls, 3.3m high ceiling, 8x20m~** ~(~[20m tent](https://www.taltpartner.se/partytalt/5282.html)~) Total price~ **~55431kr~**\n\n~_(4m longer and also more air/ height)_~\n\n## **🦊 Why it matters**\n\nFoxhole isn’t a club. It’s not a stage. It’s a **sensory cocoon**. A place where Persian carpets soak up secrets. Where immersive bass wraps around your ribs. Where candlelight flickers across crimson velvet and someone’s fingertips graze yours as you pass.\n\nBut all of that needs a roof. A real one.\n\n**Help us rebuild the space that holds the dream.**  \nJoin us, foxy one. We’ve saved you a spot on the rug. 🖤\n\n## **💝 Our other dreams**\n\n_Please see our_ [Foxhole 2.0 dream grant](https://cobudget.com/borderland/borderland-dreams-2025/cm8xj8kou122470cjynv4vyhla) for the backstory of why we are rebuilding the Foxhole from zero  \n\\_also check [Foxy Fluids](https://cobudget.com/borderland/borderland-dreams-2025/cm8xcycda29810cic5bkb35g2)",

Once the festivities are over, we’ll place the sauna 100 meters away from the shoreline or by the barn, and recompile the platform for the Alversjö community to enjoy year-round.\n\nAnd what would better complement the heat of the sauna than a cold plunge? If we can bring the scorching heat, why not bring the Arctic cold too. We’d convert a second hand freezer for the meditative health practice of cold plunge and place it behind the sauna. The sauna platform makes it easy to get in and out of the plunge.\n\n**Long-term planning**\n\nThe lakeside area and the jetty have been an enjoyable oasis for Borderlings. By choosing high quality wood, we’re creating a beautiful structure that lasts for years to come regardless of changing places. The cold plunge freezer is planned to remain in Alversjö either for year-round use or stored for future usage as a plunge or a freezer.\n\n**Extension budget**\n\nOur extension budget includes the long-term plan that we’d love to build, but if funded less, we’ll scale back the plans accordingly. The platform can be built in phases.\n\n**Detailed budget:**\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QMRhOZWcUm8Ud5oBBiLxIhKz\\_\\_7ALfR3GE647z-Jd8w/edit?gid=0#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QMRhOZWcUm8Ud5oBBiLxIhKz__7ALfR3GE647z-Jd8w/edit?gid=0#gid=0)",

Eight sets of seats.  \nIn the front we will focus on keeping the driver provided with all data and vision needed.\n\nOutside:  \nWe will clean the bus from airport chemicals, mold, grafitti and paint it white for projections and LED effects.\n\n**DAYTIME:**  \nCome hang out in our areas, connect with people and enjoy the views from above.  \nIs your camp in need of a stage? Then The Mothership comes to you.  \nIndoor and outdoor areas can be used for any collaboration.\n\n**NIGHTTIME:**  \nAt night The Mothership lights up and sails into the horizon - As long as ground is dry!  \nLED, music and fire upstairs and a cozy area downstairs. Always open to jump on.\n\n**Difference from 2024 to 2025:**  \nThe Mothership is stranded since august and in need of complete funding to reach Borderland 2025.

Two participants enter a secluding booth and sit across from each other, separated by an unique mirror. As the experience unfolds, the lighting shifts, and the mirror transforms - showing the others face, one's own or a fusion of both. At times, you’ll forget whose face you’re seeing, as your identities begin to blur and merge. It’s a place where the boundary between self and other becomes beautifully, and profoundly, uncertain.\n\nInside the booth, two sets of headphones provide a curated music experience, perfectly in sync with the rhythm of the lighting and the transformative visuals. The sound helps guide the participants through the journey, enhancing the connection and deepening the emotional experience.  \n  \nThe first time I experienced this, it left an unforgettable impact on me. I watched as my own reflection blurred into another’s, and in that moment, I saw myself in a way I never had before. I wasn’t alone—others around me emerged from the booth in awe, some laughing, some crying, all profoundly moved. That experience has stayed with me, and it’s what drives me to bring **DOPPELGÄNGER** to Borderland. I want others to feel what I felt—to step inside, to let go of the barriers between us, and to come out changed.\n\nStrangers step into **DOPPELGÄNGER** with curiosity. It’s a space where barriers dissolve, where we see ourselves in others—sometimes quite literally—and where many have walked out in awe, in laughter, or even having fallen a little bit in love.\n\nTechnically the experience works by alternating light-levels on either side of a semi-transparent mirror. By rapidly alternating these levels showing (parts of) either side our sense of self starts to dissolve into the others face. The lights and sound will be pre-programmed and controlled by a microcontroller similar to an arduino.",

Last year we bought much needed, specialist climbing equipment..

Burners came and went, passed on beloved outfits, discovered new treasures, and created completely unexpected looks.

A guide you can flip through by the fire, leave on a table in your camp’s chill space, or hand to a stranger while waiting for your coffee.\n\nThe printed JOMO Guide becomes not just a calendar, but a conversation starter, a treasure map, and an analog anchor in the chaos of Borderland.\n\nBut here’s the twist:  \n**Not everyone gets one.** The guide is _earned_ through participation and shared through intention. (+ printing 4603 physical copies ain't practical, environmental, nor economical)\n\n**Why This Dream Matters**\n\nIn a radically digital world, sometimes the most radical thing is to make something physical. To hold the magic in your hand. To leave it on a table. To find it when you need it most.\n\nThe printed JOMO Guide is not about controlling your time — it’s about sparking chance, connection, and curiosity. It’s about knowing what’s possible... so you can joyfully miss all the rest.\n\n**Contingency** \n\nThis dream is contingent upon the digital version of the JOMO Guide being completed (not part of this dream) and formatted for print **by July 3rd, 2025**. If the guide is not ready in time, **no funds will be used**, and all allocated budget will be returned to the Dream platform.  \n  \n  \n\n**BUT**\n\nLet’s be honest: some of you can’t _actually_ go a whole week without a screen.  \nAnd we love you for it.  \nSo this year, we’re also introducing:\n\n### **The JOMO Departures Board**\n\nA big, beautiful, airport-style **touchscreen** (yes, we said it) where you can browse upcoming “flights” — aka events, workshops, and happenings around Borderland.\n\nSwipe through what’s boarding soon. Discover last-minute magic. Plot your next strange adventure.\n\nNo app, no notifications, no tracking — just one place to find the fun and then get lost again.\n\n> “Attention all Borderlanders, flight BL2025 to Alversjö is now boarding at gate W30. Please have your membership ready when approaching the gate!”\n\nThis will be a **single (maybe 2-3 depending stretch goal), central meeting point(s)**, digital departure gate for analog adventures.",

For example, everyone in ABBA originates from this culture. The Dansband-culture! Dansband is not only the world’s most important and best music genre; it also gave rise to Sweden’s biggest dance style: bugg (as well as the lesser-known but more intimate fox dance). In the past, the Swedish government built dance floors and folk parks in almost every village and clearing across the country. And just look at those old photos of the sexy and cool artists—our parents’ role models—who indirectly shaped us into the fabulous creatures we are today.\n\nUnfortunately, the state monopoly on Swedish radio and TV vanished, and foreign commercial powers almost destroyed every musical ear in the country. You can no longer buy dance shoes at H&M, and dansbandsmusik has become an endangered treasure. But fear not—there is hope! A few brave souls still have hazy memories of what these dance floors looked like, and together, we can resurrect this cultural gem!\n\n**Last Year’s Triumph:**Last year, in the nick of time, we joined forces to rescue this forgotten Swedish cultural jewel by building our dansbana and hosting dance classes. We spread our love for dansband far and wide, reformatted ears that had strayed from the righteous path of Swedish music, and got countless feet moving with bugg, fox, and other swinging styles.\n\n**This Year’s Vision:**Now, we want to go bigger, shinier, and cozier. We’re forming an even larger camp with the goal of sharing more dansband with every lost soul we encounter. We’ll reuse our beloved dance floor from last year but give it a major upgrade with more far-out lighting and a new extension that can serve both as a live stage and a cuddle [corner.We’ll](corner.We’ll) teach even more people how to dance, and we’re setting up a mind-blowing light show that changes to match the music—whether it’s soft and mellow or wild and energetic.

Prepare to lose yourself in deep, chest-rattling basslines and crisp, rolling rhythms that move through you as The Bear roars in the realm of Dubstep, Drum & Bass, Jungle, and other bass-heavy music.\n\n### THE DEN\n\nWe put pride in being a low cost sound camp with our own sound system, not needing a lot of money to provide good sound and good vibes. Our vision has always been to see how far we can go using as much scraps, donations and second hand materials as possible. The costs we state in our budget are mainly transport/DJ mixer and some absolute-need-to-have upgrades from previous years. We also have some stretch goals for the extra-nice-possibility of extending the dream with a proper chill space, a lemonade bar, and further speaker/lighting upgrades.\n\n### BEAR HOURS\n\nThe Bear will mostly be active at night, offering you a space to lose yourself completely to the music. But sometimes you might catch The Bear in the daylight, drifting into slower, bass-heavy sounds like dub – deep beats to warm the day. When the bass slumbers, fellow dreamers are welcome to bring their magic to The Den.",

That’s **Nyotaimori**—Japan’s most _intimate_ culinary tradition, where **your table isn’t just set… it’s _alive!_**\n\n## **Why Just Eat When You Can _Feast_?** 🎎🍣\n\n*   **Foodie Meets Performance Art** – Each bite is a delicate dance between flavor and presentation. (Pro tip: Chopstick control = _mandatory._ No accidental tickling!)\n    \n*   **Fresher Than Your Ex’s Apology** – Only the highest-grade fish makes the cut, because if it’s going on a human canvas, it better be _perfect._\n    \n*   **The Rules of Engagement (Yes, There Are Rules)** ✋🍱\n    \n\n✅ **Respect the Canvas** – This is _art_, not an all-you-can-eat buffet. Slow, deliberate bites only.  \n✅ **Chopstick Jedi Skills Required** – Precision is key. (No spearing—this isn’t a kebab!)  \n✅ **Temperature Matters** – Body heat keeps the fish _just right_, but don’t linger too long—sushi waits for no one!\n\nWe will also provide vegan alternatives!",

It is a space designed to support spiritual curiosity and reflection, especially for those who prefer to explore in solitude or small, intentional moments.\n\nAnd when you're ready, you can step back out—shifted, soothed, or perhaps more in touch with your essence 🌙.\n\nWe are seeking DREAM funding to help bring this vision to life, including:\n\n✨ Materials to build the physical cabinet + tunnel entrance  \n✨ Decor and lighting to create a warm, otherworldly atmosphere  \n✨ Equipment for a tea station with sensual service elements  \n✨ A small sound system for ambient music and sit-down DJ sets  \n✨ Ritual and tarot supplies to guide gentle inner exploration\n\nThe Spiritual Closet is both a retreat and a ritual—an invitation to remember the magic within, in a world that so often pulls us outward.",

Have the fairy lights, glitter and sparkles tired your out? Are you mad at your camp mates, but have nowhere to vent about it?\n\nWalking around aimlessly, suddenly you stumble upon a mound. The mound turns out to be the start of a tunnel. Slowly you crawl through the dark tunnel. What do you have to lose anyway. Soon you have arrived. A dark cave opens up. Welcome to the Mole Hole.\n\n**What is the Mole Hole?** It is the places where the dark corners of your soul are welcomed. It is a place where your good vibes can take a rest (and be left at the door). It is a place where you don’t need to be happy. Where you leave you fairly lights at the door. It is a place where you can snarl and hiss at the state of the world (and the state of yourself). We will do our best to support your bad vibes and make them even worse, until you eventually tire of being angry, upset, sad, annoyed or icky and decide to go back into the good vibes, glitter and sparkles again. Once we start to sense your good vibes bubbling up, you will be asked to leave.\n\nThe mole is a misunderstood animal. It doesn’t mean to make a mess out of your rose garden. It isn’t mean when it hisses and snarls at you. The mole is simply pretty blind and lives in darkness. The mole can’t see colorful lights and sparkles. The mole doesn’t see you when it hisses and snarls at you. The mole enjoys the grounded comforts of digging tunnels, chilling in the darkness and slurping up some underground delicacies. The mole can occasionally enjoy some blind, snarly encounters with other moles. Or simply sit in silence with them. Sometimes the mole might even invite guests for some underground workshops and events.\n\nDuring the day, the Mole Hole will host workshops and events such as Anger Meditation and Venting Circle, Screaming and Hissing Meditation, and Static Dance (or Anti-Ecstatic Dance). During the night, the Mole Hole Bar opens its tunnel. You will first have a chance to get even more annoyed by the mole on duty before you get in. Once you're inside, you can order annoying, underground drinks and snacks at the bar. They may or may not be served to you. Pick a fight with the bartender if you wish, they will enjoy it. Sit back with an annoying book. Or listen to the absolute shit music they're playing.\n\nWhen there are no events, workshops or bar service hours in the Mole Hole, you may come there at any time to hiss, snarl or annoy yourself in the dark as needed.\n\n**Part of the Vagaverse™ vision**",

This feels like a sanctuary, a naturally formed tree-house offering refuge from the world. But as you settle into this verdant embrace, a disquieting feeling begins to bloom. The vibrant life around you seems too intense, the colors too saturated, the very air thrumming with an unseen energy. The plants possess an unnatural vitality, their forms hinting at something beyond the familiar. And in the steamy stillness, you sense a presence, a silent awareness that permeates the very fabric of this seemingly idyllic space.\n\n**For the Pragmatics:**\n\nThis will be an artificially constructed rainforest that pushes the boundaries of reality. The room will mimic actual rainforest ambience by being heated, designed top to toe with exotic plants and having humidifiers and aroma diffusers work in the background.

          "value": "The **_Enchanted Forest_** transforms an entire room into an immersive, dark forest post-apocalyptic space—a place where nature has quietly reclaimed a once-grand and seemingly important area now fallen into ruin. Overgrown branches, wild weeds, and scattered earth set the stage for a forgotten, doomed place that hides profound insight—a crucial clue embedded within the larger narrative of _Pan-Delirium_, the heart of the Dreamer’s Maze. Instead of concealing the damage from years of semi-flooding and poor maintenance, we thought of embracing the time-decay to create a limbo zone that feels slightly creepy, slightly haunted, but perhaps also enchanted!\n\nImagine stepping into a space that feels slightly different from the others. It’s quiet, and there’s little to no light. It feels like you’re in the wrong place. The visitors can go back to where they came from, but if they have the courage to step forward, they will have learned something new by the time they leave the room again. As visitors advance through the room, little forest spirits come to rescue — mysterious helpers on a hero’s journey. Embedded throughout the room are motion sensors—discreetly placed on the floor, walls, and objects—they track the visitor’s movement in real time. As they come close to these sensors, small wireless light bulbs or hidden speakers activate and alternate, creating dynamic, reactive trails that guide the visitors through the darkness, revealing an important puzzle piece by the end of the journey. These spectral guides don’t speak, but their presence feels like an ancient echo; like they know something you don’t, and for some reason... they want to help, leading the visitor through what feels like an escape room experience. The space is intentionally confining and disorienting—meant to bring about the feeling of being “lost”—until suddenly, the lights begin to flicker, and a path emerges. This turning point, inspires the recovery of hope and offers a moment of profound reflection after a journey through darkness, directly echoing the living heart of Pan-Delirium’s narrative within _Dreamer’s Maze_.\n\n**Logistics Plan & Production**\n\nGiven that our plan is to source most new tech components from China, I based my search on available options (platforms like Aliexpress) as I for one do not have the means to realize this dream just yet.\n\n**1\\. Sensor Systems & Controllers**\n\n*   **_Motion & Proximity Detection:_**\n    \n    *   _PIR Sensor Modules:_ affordable and easy to integrate à can be embedded in the floor or hidden in props/decor\n        \n        *   Check (AliExpress): HC-SR501 PIR Sensor Module\n            \n    *   _Ultrasonic Sensors or IR Distance Sensors:_ more precise tracking\n        \n        *   Check (AliExpress): HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor (or Sharp IR sensors)\n            \n    *   _Pressure Sensing Mats:_ for detecting footsteps more subtly\n        \n        *   Check (AliExpress): Pressure Sensing Mat Module\n            \n*   **_Controller & Connectivity:_**\n    \n    *   _ESP32 Development Boards via MIDI, serial data, or CV for smooth signal routing:_ apparently can handle multiple sensor inputs and controlling outputs wirelessly. We think the built-in WiFi/Bluetooth might be able to connect with both Bitwig and Touchdesigner\n        \n        *   Check (AliExpress): ESP32 Dev Board\n            \n        *   _Additional Microcontroller Options_ (depending on complexity): Arduino Mega boards:\n            \n            *   Check (AliExpress): Arduino Mega 2560\n                \n\n**2\\. Output Systems**\n\n*   **_Lighting:_**\n    \n    *   _LED Strips:_ Use addressable LED strips like WS2812B, which allow for dynamic color changes and patterns à can be hidden behind decor or embedded in the floor (as long as the lights remain visible)\n        \n        *   Check (AliExpress): WS2812B LED Strip\n            \n    *   low-power _Wireless Light Bulbs_ (controllable via microcontrollers): For larger, focused light cues, and for effect:\n        \n        *   Check (AliExpress): WiFi/Bluetooth LED Bulb Module\n            \n    *   _LED Controllers:_ to manage the lighting effects (ensure a compatible controller that works with chosen LED strips)\n        \n        *   Check (Antratek): Wifi/ ESP32 12V RGB LED Strip Controllers\n            \n*   **_Audio:_**\n    \n    *   _Small Wireless Speakers:_ compact, battery-powered speakers that can be triggered by sensor input (ensure they have a low latency response)\n        \n        *   Check (AliExpress): Mini Bluetooth Speaker Module\n            \n    *   _Audio Signal Modules:_ a more integrated approach (consider modules that can be directly interfaced with controllers to trigger pre-recorded sound cues)\n        \n        *   Check (AliExpress): MP3 Playback Module\n            \n\n**3\\. Connectivity & Integration Components**\n\n*   _Wires & Connectors:_ new, reliable, flexible cables suitable for embedding in walls and floors à rated for indoor use and, if needed, concealed with natural materials (otherwise they can be either covered or left in the open, suiting the aesthetic, unless we decide to rather not do that because of safety reasons)\n    \n    *   Check (AliExpress): Flexible Silicone Cable\n        \n*   _Power Supplies:_ big cumulative load of sensors, LED strips, and controllers à something sturdy -- Safety is paramount! It’s important to ensure proper voltage and current specifications\n    \n    *   Check (AliExpress): 5V/12V Multi Channel Power Supply Modules\n        \n\n**4\\. Decor & Installation Materials**\n\n*   **_Natural & Reclaimed Materials_** to evoke the mood and keep it sustainable:\n    \n    *   _Artificial (or real) Moss & Foliage:_ These can be used to drape sensors or cover wiring discreetly\n        \n    *   _Branch & Wood Accents:_ To create that overgrown, abandoned feel, source faux or real branches that have been treated for safety\n        \n*   **_Additional Ambiance_** to enhance the mystique:\n    \n    *   _Fog/Smoke Machines:_ Even a small smoke machine can add to the mystical, post-apocalyptic vibe\n        \n        *   Check (AliExpress): Mini Fog Machine\n            \n\n**Timeline & Implementation:**\n\n1.  **_Prototyping Phase_**(before 21/07/2025):\n    \n\n*   Build a small-scale model to test sensor placements, light/sound triggers, and signal routing\n    \n*   Validate software integration between Bitwig, Touchdesigner, and hardware components\n    \n\n2.  **_Installation Phase_** (Build-up):\n    \n\n*   Install sensors, lighting, and audio elements in the chosen room with careful attention to safety and aesthetics\n    \n*   Collaborate with other Dreamer’s Maze artists to ensure narrative consistency\n    \n\n3.  **_Testing & Tuning_** (Build-Up):\n    \n\n*   Conduct multiple walkthroughs to fine-tune interactive responses and overall ambience\n    \n*   Adjust sensor sensitivity and output patterns to match the desired “forest spirit” effect",

Now affluent with exabytes of paradigm-shattering intel, the team will establish a clandestine hub for intelligence exchange where secret information can be mined, perfected and traded like black-market diamonds.![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dreamswtf/image/upload/v1744749134/dreams/x5nmpn210v3q2tqph2xb.png)\n\n## What is the DEEP STATE SPEAKEASY? **🕵**\n\nIt's the place where deep state spies can speak freely and enter deep states with other spies without having to worry about being spied upon by other spies. A neutral watering hole for covert operators, information brokers and other actors with assets too precious to disclose out in the open.\n\n# Spaces and structures\n\n**💫 Portal**  \nFlipping the 2024 logic around, the conceptual focal point and expression of our portal will shift from ostentatious to secretive…              \n\n**🎪 Main Tent**  \nFuturistic interior with lots of surface area for decadent lounging. Interactive gadgets and Mission Control (our quest board) promise to entertain the curious and engage the ambitious.             \n\n**🔦 Lights**  \nBuilding on last year's P O L Y C H R O M A T I C paradise of lasers, spots, LED's, disco balls, smoke, mirrors and projection mapping - we extend the lights concept to also include a symbolic reclaiming of the rainbow (that's right, we are taking the rainbow back from the queers). 2025 is the year of the PRISMS, baby.\n\n**🎻 Music**  \nThe top notch setup of previous years return with a new musical direction that creates space for a different flavour of laid back DEEP STATE-immersion. Contribute to our stretch budget and we will get a high calibre extension to keep up with your HiFi standards.\n\n**🔶 The floor**  \nWe will significantly upgrade the dancefloor with foam pads, and the chill space with soft faux fur to create a plush, tactile retreat for 6AM decompression, conversation, and sensory exploration.\n\n**☄️ Events**  \nThe DEEP STATE SPEAKEASY will be a place for events. Other than parties, we have **previously** held Konfrans (set of 6-8 prepared talks w/ discussions), Live music (incl. jazz & opera), Mission Control (themed quest board), Clinic of Psychosurgery (psychologically informed workshops), and more. **This year**, in addition to building on what worked before, we want to explore the **6AM** timeslot as well.",

But somehow, we became a natural stop along the way—a place where people pause on their journey home from a wild night, an intense experience, or just the beautiful chaos of the burn. We don’t host, we don’t perform—we’re just here, and people seem to like that.\n\nFor the past two years, our 3x3 pavilion, packed with carpets, pillows, and soft things, has been our little refuge. But we’ve battled the rain, a flimsy setup, and—more than once—overcrowded cuddle puddles where there just wasn’t enough space for everyone to comfortably flop. That’s why we’re looking to expand—not to add more _stuff_, just to have _more room_ for the same cozy, low-key vibe that has made The Leftovers what it is.\n\nA grant would help us upgrade to a sturdier, larger shelter—one that can handle the elements and the unexpected influx of people who, for some reason, keep finding their way to us. Nothing fancy, nothing extra—just a little more space to be.\n\n_All items will also go into the BurnLibrary in Norway to be reused by the community for future burns, both Borderland and Norwegian ones :)_",

Rent some better lights that work from the grid and get a backup power bank for the ones that run by USB, the smaller details.\n\nHopefully, this artwork will be even more magical, react to the distant music (gently), and have some more movement. In my dream, Mycelium will be a space to travel to some realm where you are needed at that moment. Weather is a nice, gentle forest picnic place during the day, or a crazy portal to Friday tea time.\n\nIn hopes, there will be bigger wooden panels with different artwork, and different lights to guide people to the place and pop the art in twilight. I will also be open to suggestions to create this better and better. if there is enough budget, the mycelium will start as a teaser from nearby (as a smaller artwork), which didn't happen last year. Also, there's guidance needed so people will not stomp stomp to nearby camp tents or fall into the forest. I will reprogram the lights and readjust the setups. Will need to buy or rent some new carbines, etc., to hang the strips to the trees since last year friend kindly loaned part of his gear.\n\nEvery day the lights need to be switched on, so there were also hopes of somewhat automation in the future.\n\nThe budget seems to be broken, I cannot edit it in any way - I will calculate some of the expenses again when it works.",

Is there a difference between traditional indigenous ceremonial and sacred cacao? What is the difference between this and raw cacao? How is this different from our western world commercialised bulk cocoa and chocolate?\n\nWe will immerse into the **biohacking world** and talk about e.g. the nutritional profile, the bioactive components of cacao, biochemistry, bioavailability, bioactive combinations with other substances, such as nootropics, adaptogens, prescription drugs, and psychedelics, and the benefits and risks in terms of physiological and psychological impact.\n\nWe will talk about purpose, conscious usage, and its dosing for intended effects: How may cacao be used in everyday life for diverse purposes, such as improving your baseline moods, enhancing your physical practice as a PWO (at the gym, on the yoga mat, on the golf course, on the bouldering wall, et c.), boosting your breathworks, going deeper into meditation, or exploring your own introspective journey further?\n\nSpecifically, we will dig deeper into the complex and intriguing topic of combining different serotonin-enhancing substances (for example SSRIs), or MAOIs, and the risks of serotonin syndrome/toxicity.\n\nOf course, there will be space for Q&As and discussion.\n\nTogether, we will shape the talk, and you as a participant and co-creator will influence the course of the discussion!\n\nWe will round up the bio-talk with a ceremonial cacao ritual for those who feel called, where you are invited to drink sacred cacao, meditation, intention setting, and sharing - all on a voluntary basis.\n\n**What to expect:**\n\n*   Historical background - traditional indigenous usage and western-world commercialisation\n    \n*   Definitions of cacao concepts\n    \n*   Nutritional profile\n    \n*   Bioactive components/substances and biochemistry\n    \n*   Bioavailability and bioactive combinations with other substances\n    \n*   Benefits and risks in terms of physiological and psychological impact\n    \n*   Purposeful usage and dosing for intended effects\n    \n*   A scientific approach to the serotonin toxicity/syndrome risks\n    \n*   Q&As & discussion\n    \n*   Optional heart-opening cacao ceremony with intention setting and sharing\n    \n\n**Welcome to this bioscientific approach to connect to The Spirit of Sacred Cacao!**",

Your stomach growls, you didn’t realize how hungry you were until now.\n\nAnd that’s when you see it.\n\nAt the edge of the dimly lit street, parked as if it had always been there, sits a trolley bathed in a warm, golden glow. The scent hits you first - melting cheese, toasted bread, something spicy, something sweet. You blink. Was this here before? It doesn’t matter.\n\nDrawn in by the sizzle of butter hitting a hot griddle. A figure behind the counter grins, flipping a sandwich with practiced ease. “Looks like you need a toastie,” they say, as if they’ve been expecting you.\n\nThe menu is scrawled on a wooden board, but it barely matters. Every sandwich is a little different, every bite a surprise. Crunchy, creamy, spicy, sweet - whatever it is, it’s exactly what you need. You take a bite, and the warmth spreads through you, melting away the cold, the hunger, the tiredness of the night.\n\nBut just as suddenly as you found it, the trolley is gone.\n\nYou glance back over your shoulder, half-expecting to see it still there. But the only sign it was ever real is the lingering taste of buttery, crispy perfection. Maybe it’ll be there next time. Or maybe, just maybe, it only appears when you need it most.\n\nSo next time you’re walking home, hungry, a little cold—keep your eyes open. You never know when the Cheesy Toastie Trolley might roll into your night.",

By removing choice paralysis and streamlining the experience, the installation invites players to instantly jump into the game.\n\nAt set hours, the installation “awakens” with a pre-selected game, launching everyone into the same match. There’s no menu, no launcher, no fuss. You sit down, pick up the mouse, and go.\n\nEach gaming station features a Raspberry Pi connected to a monitor, mechanical keyboard (illuminated, of course), mouse, headphones, and a custom beautiful black LED luminaire that reacts to player input:\n\n*   Keyboard presses influence the hue of the player’s light.\n    \n*   Mouse clicks trigger pulses or blinks, creating a visual echo of the player’s actions.\n    \n\n### Structure & Materials\n\nThe core of BorderLAN is an octagonal array of eight compact gaming stations. Each consists of:\n\n*   Raspberry Pi unit preloaded with game builds\n    \n*   17–22” monitor\n    \n*   Keyboard + optical mouse with mouse pad\n    \n*   Wired headphones\n    \n*   Custom-built LED luminaire (WS2812 or similar), connected to each RPi, reactive to input\n    \n\nThe stations are enclosed in a low-profile wooden structure forming the octagon.\n\n### Decor\n\nI'm interested integrating a visual element as if the players are in Swedish LAN fever dream. A custom wallpaper with Billys Pan Pizza, Gorbys Pirog and Glocken Gold design etc. Perhaps seating could be made up by Dr. Pepper bottles etc.\n\n### Interaction\n\nAt designated hours, the day’s selected game boots up and automatically connects all Raspberry Pis into the same server. No logins, no menus—just muscle memory and shared focus.\n\nEach player’s input—keyboard taps and mouse clicks—feeds into a responsive lighting and sound system. As participants play, their actions trigger glowing pulses and a layered soundscape that transforms rapid commands into a kind of chaotic, joyful cacophony. It becomes a playful audiovisual portrait of collective attention.\n\nBORDERLAN features Action Quake 2 and Quake III Arena. Since we are constrained by using Linux (Raspbian) the number of LAN games is limited for this edition, but future editions of BorderLAN may run on dedicated Windows machines, and/or come in an arcade cabinet edition.\n\n### For The Borderland 2025\n\nAt first glance, BorderLAN might seem at odds with the ethos of immediacy. Plugging into a screen in the middle of the woods? Really? But we all burn differently. For some, transcendence happens through fire and dance. For others, it’s a LAN at 2 am with strangers-turned-teammates, lit by reactive LEDs and echoed by the pulse of a clicking mouse.\n\n### Team\n\n**Jonas Johansson** – Programmer and media artist, building interactive installations.

          "value": "TL;DR\n\n**It's a Klub and it’s Pink, it’s the PinKlub! a Piano, a Stage, a Bar and it’s all just really Pink!** \n\n**You can play, sing, perform and really just express your beautiful self!** \n\n**Sit inside the piano or make the stage your home. It's a freakin' Pink Piano Theater!** \n\nAnd Now... Here are some more details (that you probably won't bother to read):\n\nThe PinKlub project is a collaborative space, with a grand-sized piano painted in a vivid shade of pink, serving as both a visual art piece and a musical instrument. The stage is a pink portal of performance through which any magical being can cast itself and shine their creative radiating beams of love. It is complemented by a bar and a chill-out space where you can meander around or lay softly and vibe to whatever ambiance has been created by the people, the piano and the stage. \n\nThe installation seeks to dissolve the boundaries between artist and audience, creating a space where every participant can engage with the instrument or the scene, contribute to the soundscape and dreamscape, and experience the spontaneous creation of expressive art. A space to be seen and not judged. The gift is simple: An open stage, a cozy covered space, a pink piano, and the invitation to be weird and wonderful together.\n\nImagine a speak-easy bar, add a piano, a stage, maybe a cuddle-puddle. BUT, this is not just any music lounge, but a theater that’s audaciously painted in the most eye-popping pink you've ever seen, planted right in the heart of Borderland's vibrant landscape. It's like this piano chugged a whole bottle of 'notice me' potion and now, it’s practically flirting with every borderling that walks by. Whether you’re a maestro or can barely distinguish a C from a G, or a wanderer with a secret performer inside, the PinKlub is your home and if this is your first time in the limelight, this space doesn’t care—it just wants your fingers to dance a little jig on its keys and your voice to simmer out into the quiet night. It’s there for the fun, the spontaneous duets at dusk, the laugh-out-loud attempts at chopsticks, and maybe, just maybe, to coax out some hidden talents among us. So why not strut up, give it a whirl, and let this peppy, pink theater turn your Borderland experience up to an eleven on the unforgettable scale?\n\nAdding a twist to the traditional piano setup, the Pink Piano project introduces an innovative feature that lets you not just play music, but truly immerse yourself in it. Imagine this: part of the piano is cleverly designed as an open, cozy nook, big enough for you and a couple of friends to literally sit inside. Here, nestled among soft cushions that echo the piano's pink vibrancy, you can sing along to the tunes, strum a guitar, or simply kick back with one of those pink margaritas in hand. It’s a unique spot. This 'inside-the-piano' hangout spot isn’t just about watching the action—it’s about being part of the melody, the rhythm, and the unforgettable stories being created. The bar allows you to while away and just listen, relax, tune in, zone out.\n\nAt night, the PinKlub transforms into a mesmerizing spectacle. The vibrant pink hue of the space is complemented by carefully arranged lighting that illuminates it from within and around its frame. These lights enhance the piano’s visibility and create a magical, inviting aura, drawing participants towards it as the sun sets.\n\nSo, this is your call to action. **Don't just stand there; dive into the pink.** Tickle those ivories, belt out your best tunes, become a stage freak or simply soak in the vibes from the comfort of the piano's belly. This isn't just any art installation; it's a party, Borderland’s Moulin Rouge, and a chill-out lounge rolled into one ridiculously pretty pink package. Come on over to the PinKlub at Borderland, where every tone promises a splash of fun and every moment spent is a brushstroke in our vibrant, artistic canvas. Let's make some noise, let's stir some spirits, and let's make sure that the only thing more unforgettable than our melodies and moments is the Pinkness of our Piano Theater.\n\nIt's a Klub, a Piano, a Stage. It's Pink. You can play, sing and express yourself. Sit inside it, make the stage your home. It's a freakin' Pink Piano Theater!\n\nBecause music, theater and cuddle puddles make people come together.",

To do so, we’re seeking funding for a state-of-the-art-cheap-second-hand sound system that includes robust speakers, a professional mixer, and reliable microphones.

This is a temple for those who long to truly connect — with themselves, with others, and with something greater. This is a place to explore the edges of your comfort zone, dive into your depths, and rise freer and more authentic.\n\nThrough ancient troll magic - **tantra, breathwork, autentic relating, shadow-work, mindfulness, shibari, acroyoga, embodiment and various exercises in emotional intelligence,** you’re invited to ponder what it truly means to be human at the deeper levels. Each workshop is a distinct gateway inward, supporting self-development, healing and integration.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dreamswtf/image/upload/v1744019703/dreams/j5lace2lfemoop0xvg93.png)This year, the Hall is evolving. While the tent remains the same size (70 m²!), the interior is undergoing a beautiful transformation — with puzzle mats, flowing fabrics, ambient lighting, and an even deeper sense of cozy magic. After a few summers of use, the tent also needs a bit of repair.\n\nThe space will be more inviting than ever, ready to host both dynamic workshops and slow, intimate moments of connection. While workshops are a big part of what we do, we also envision the Hall as a place for soulful hangouts and meaningful rest.\n\nDoes this sound like it's right up your alley? Then please consider helping the trolls to level up the Hall!\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dreamswtf/image/upload/v1744019677/dreams/ogcmjmijdj7mqsmqafax.png)\n\n🧌 **Cave of the Tantric Trolls – 30,000 SEK**  \nThe essential setup. At this level, we can create a simple yet soulful space for workshops — dry, safe, and somewhat intimate. A grounding space where transformation begins.\n\n🌟 **The Great Hall of the Tantric Trolls – 40,000 SEK**  \nThe temple becomes magical! We’ll furnish the tent with beautiful fabrics and invest in new speakers, microphones, and workshop materials. We’ll also add carpets and cushions to make certain workshops — like meditation or circling — more comfortable. The space becomes softer, shroomier, and more inviting.\n\n🌈 **Sacred Temple of the Tantric Trolls – 50,000 SEK**  \nNow we're talking real freaking troll magic. This level creates a truly sacred space — beautifully decorated, shroomy, and mysterious. We'll also build a cozy cuddle puddle area for integration after intense emotional workshops or long nights, with ambient lighting and sound-dampening décor to nourish the soul\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dreamswtf/image/upload/v1744019656/dreams/nfvrmlmaxacyosaenqam.png)",

A place to host workshops, find stillness, breathe deeply, and reconnect in the midst of the beautiful chaos.\n\nStep inside, and you’ll find warmth, calm, and quiet magic. Soft lights, natural textures, and the scent of wood and earth invite you to slow down. It is a sanctuary within the storm — a glade beneath the branches of the World Tree, where inspiration flows and all are welcome.\n\nWith support from the Dream Fund, we hope to make Ygg’s Halla thrive once again — for the good of the forest, the flame, and the family we call Borderland.\n\nPs.

Soon, you realise that it is the music following and reacting to your moves. You wonder; perhaps you hear the core of your very being. Are you the composer of this universe? As you move your hands and fingers, new frequencies emerge. With each movement of your body, melodic combinations of sounds take form. Transcending time and space, you dance freely, filling the space with your energy, with your soul's melody. Perhaps someone is lucky to have witnessed your symphony.\n\nWhat an experience! You've discovered your body anew and have got into a hypnotic trance of subtle or erratic movements. The music that's been in your head is now liberated. You've experienced the power of your nervous system; the impeccable arrangement of your muscles and energy channels. You feel the magic of every impulse and movement, existing only in the present moment, vibrating, resonating, as long as you're here.

While reusing the things we got for the first edition of the Beach Resort, we want to request some budget to make the hotel even more beautiful this year.   \nWe call it the bonus edition: This includes an extra cozy cuddle puddle with air matresses floating like on water beds, warmed by a heating blanket, surrounded by lots of cozy fluff stuff.  \nFurther, this year's hotel includes a wellness/spa area. As usual, we'll build a cave with salt crystals for you to discover the hidden treasures of PortoRica. While lounging on our sun chairs you can enjoy the warm embrace of golden light next to our sexy Shibarbies flying the sky. \n\nOur hotel will be opened for workshops at daytime. Further we will host two slutty partys.\n\nBecause we're all about entertainment, Slutsgaarden has some surprises for you: Spin the wheel of fortune and put your luck to the test. Will destiny deem you worthy of a trendy slut chain, a proud SLUT stamp, or perhaps a playful and naughty spank with COCO-consent? \n\nAs we love naughty gifts, the beach resort offers a DIY self-service station for your own personalized necklaces, wristbands or bodychains.\n\n_Get ready for some Coco-Loco!_ \n\nWe love to provide you the most amazing trip within the limits of our resources and the funding we get <3 _slutty greets_",

This is a place for mysteries to unfold and for us to step into the new together. We want to invite you all to the _Mugwort Mystery Dream_. \n\nOur stretch goal is to set up a round yurt-style tent big enough for 15-20 people in the vicinity of “The sunny hill” close to the lake at Borderland. We have found an amazing tent for this purpose. It is called _Wulff Nature Waterdrop Starglaze_ and it is 5 metres in diameter. There are windows in the ceiling of the tent so that you can watch the stars at night from inside the tent. The tent will belong to the BurnerBox after the festival so that everyone in the community can have access to it.\n\nInside the tent there are mattresses, pillows and blankets in white or beige colours as well as bright light therapy lamps to create a room of brightness. We have deliberately chosen mattresses of good quality for comfort and wool blankets because of their outstanding ability to give warmth. There is music and decorations made with small crystals hanging from the ceiling. There are also Mugwort plants hanging along the walls of the tent. \n\nWhen you come here, we will serve you tea made of Mugwort which we pick in the forest around the Borderland camp. Mugwort is a plant which has been used for millennia for its medicinal qualities. It has been called “The Dreamer” for its capacity to induce lucid dreams and to open us up for journeying into the unknown. It is not a drug, but a powerful plant medicine. This means that depending on how sensitive you are to its influence, the deeper it will take you. Our plan is to do two ceremonies with Mugwort during the festival. During these you will be guided into the bright realm of the plant and into a state of being in which you can expand your capacities to see into the future and to embody higher vibrations.\n\nTo honour the limited resources of the festival we have also put together a smaller scale version of this vision, where the tent is a tipi style tent with a diameter of 4,15 m (and without windows) and the mattresses and blankets are of lesser quality. There are no decorations apart from the plants, no heater, no light therapy lamps and only a small loudspeaker.\n\n**Who we are:**\n\nWe are Omi-peah Ryding and Bihter Kartheuser and we met on Borderland last year. Bi is a certified trauma therapist and a yoga and meditation teacher. Omi has worked deeply with plant medicine for the last three years and has completed a 1,5 yearlong advanced priestess training.\n\n**What we wish to offer as part of this dream:**\n\n*   Two ceremonies with Mugwort, on the second and on the fourth day of the festival\n    \n*   A space to come and rest and to spend time with Mugwort on your own in silence\n    \n*   A walk into the forest to pick the plants together on the first day of the festival\n    \n*   We are also open for suggestion from the community of how to use the space when there is not one of our planned activities going on",

Expect dramatic objections to your love-union. \n\nA MAXIMUM WEDDING. If you believe a wedding should have religious roots, but aren’t sure which one – here you’ll get elements from all of them, in a glorious mix! \n\nA SINGLE WEDDING.

Here, we serve cheese on penises and pair it with exquisite wines. It’s a place of laughter, indulgence, and sensory delight, where **cheese, wine, dicks, and mouths** meet in an unexpected **symphony of taste and pleasure.**\n\nTake a seat at our red-and-white checkered tables, let Édith Piaf fill the air, and indulge in a carefully curated cheese platter, served of course on a cock. Our flirtatious sommeliers will guide you through the tasting: a brie with a Burgundy, a comté paired with a Chardonnay. An experience designed to tease and delight.\n\nIn addition to what’s outlined in our budget, we’re seeking a few bold volunteers willing to offer their beautiful, erect penises as serving platters for the cheese. An intimate and unforgettable contribution to the experience. Our dedicated fluffer will ensure all penises are freshly cleaned and fully erect, ready for service.\n\nComté on a cock. Chardonnay on your lips.\n\n**Flensost & Vin vous attend.**",

          "value": "TLDR: You might have met us last year, and Welcome Home, Darling comes back this year with an **even warmer, homier concept**. Creating space for you, and all your cosy and cuddly needs. Our concept consists of an amazing and gorgeous tent, that is a cozy hangout at night and a calm event venue during the day: But we need your help to make this happen!\n\n## Have you ever wanted a bit of a break from the hustle-bustle of the Playa?\n\nAnd just like chill, and relax ‘at home’ mid Borderland? We got you! \"Welcome Home, Darling\" offers a home away from home. Like your own cozy living room. Take a breather and enter our magical \"cottage\". A place where you are always welcome, and where you can come home and wind down. WHD is also known for our amazing soup kitchen, serving hungry Borderlings since… Well ever since we moved to Alversjö.\n\nLuckily we already have a bunch of big tents, that we use to create an amazing communal space, a magical living room in a wonderful Morroccan wedding tent. \n\nDuring the day, our space will be hosting for talks, performances, workshops and other amazing experiences curated by members of our camp. If you reach out, we might have room for your event as well.  \nThe Morroccan tent has a middle layer of black-out fabric, so it is possible to make the living room pretty dark and quite cool even during the day.\n\nAt night, the living room provides the bustling playa with a cozy and warm place for you to chill, cuddle and relax while listening to music that actually contains lyrics. favorite tunes. There is also room for board games, jigsaw puzzles and whatever else you could wish for.\n\n### **What we have done so far:**\n\nOver the past years we've brought you the most beautiful venue with our magical, Moroccan tent - which we cozied up for you.\n\nLast year we **waterproofed the big tent** and invested in **proper re-useable flooring**. One that doesn't care about the uneven ground of Alversjö. We also filled the floor with lush carpets, making making sure that your feet and behinds were comfy and warm.\n\nWe also purchased heaters that allowed us to heat up the tent, even if the setup of them wasn't perfect.\n\n### **What do we want to do now?**\n\nLast year we got by with the bare minimum of furniture and decoration. We would love to expand on what we have and raise people up from the cold ground. We want to invest in proper couches, turning the moroccan tent into a comfy living room, complete with all the furniture you would expect in your grandma's home. So if you happen to have a cuckoo clock lying around, then please donate it.\n\nWe want to make the living room even more open and welcoming, allowing people to use it all through the night and early mornings for relaxations, fun and good times.\n\n### **What we need funding for:**\n\nWe want to get more actual furniture, proper couches, old timey cabinets and even old oil paintings, to help create the vibe of a living room. And most important, a proper fireplace (that is safe for indoor use).\n\nWe want to build a better casing for our heaters, to ensure that they do not tip over or end up burning anything or anybody down. And those heaters need gas to run all through the night every night. So we would love to purchase more gas bottles and fill our empty ones. And for good measure, get a carbon monoxide measurer.  \nwant to refill our gas bottles.\n\nTo make sure that everyone can find their new favorite chill spot, we want to build a lit up sign for the camp, showing who we are and tempting people to come inside.\n\nLast year we purchased a container, to store a lot of our equipment, and we would love to have the rent covered.\n\nHowever the container cannot store even half of our gear, and we haven't dared storing our expensive equipment there, so our tents, carpets lights and lots of other stuff that is used for various burns around Scandinavia, is stored in Odense.",

You are all cordially invited to our big bang, the last dance of the peacocks, our Swan Song. The peacocks will treat you with the most spectacular farewell you've ever experienced, and leave in love with the feathers for the rest of your life. You're very welcome.\n\n**WELCOME TO VANITY SQUARE**\n\nWhen you enter Vanity Square, you enter a world of beauty and abundance. This is the catwalk baby and you gotta know how to strut. In our part of town, we raise the disco diva from the dead and dazzle those dirty thoughts of yours til' you got no shame left in your feathers.\n\nImagine the most luxurious castle of 70 m2 dripping in gold, glitter and silk. Imagine a shining throne at the center stage to host the queens of the court. Imagine the iconic Peacock catwalk running through the room, begging you to show your feathers to the roaring crowd. Imagine the whole scene filled with beautiful birds and the dirtiest tunes you've ever heard. Well, if that doesn't get your beak wet, I don't know what will.\n\nVanity Square is where the Peacocks welcome the rest of the playa to take part in the prancing and the posing. This is where we host our events, and where you can join us on the catwalk. But please be sure to make an effort, we want to see you dressed to impress and ready to undress. We don't care much about your inner journeys, as long as the strut is on fleek.\n\n**WELCOME TO THE POUNCING PEACOCK BAR**\n\nThe birds down at Vanity Square ain't for the faint of heart, and anyone who's visited the Pouncing Peacock Bar knows what we're talking about. This is the place to be for anyone with a sense of what's up, where the only thing tastier than the drinks are the bartenders. Do put your face on though and don't forget to compliment the Bar Bitch. We all know who the main act is.\n\n**WELCOME TO THE PEACOCK PARTIES AND EVENTS**\n\nVanity Square will host a number of events that will make anyone who misses them regretting it for the rest of the burn, such as our legendary opening party on the Tuesday, and the revival of last years prize winning show - the Queer Extravaganza party, and more. There will also be workshops and events during the days.\n\n**Why we're applying for dream funds**\n\nVanity Square and the Peacock premises needs fund to maintain and renew the venue for this years fancy flaunting. We need funds for the renting of sound equipment and getting new lightings (buying doesn't make sense since this is our last year). We will also put in work to create a bigger and very spectacular front for Vanity Square, to add to the general area vibe and to the Borderland skyline.

This interactive light and smoke installation provides a short, intense sensory reset, using voice, touch, and stroboscopic light to amplify raw expression.\n\nParticipants step up to a repurposed oil drum, now a reactive chamber. Placing their hands on a sensor triggers a plume of smoke. A few seconds later, a green strobe flashes, signaling the moment to let go and scream. The louder and longer the scream, the more intensely the strobe pulses, creating an immediate feedback loop between sound and light. The entire experience lasts just 3–5 seconds, offering a visceral, cathartic release.\n\n### Build\n\nSTROBOSCOP combines stroboscopic light, sound-reactive sensors, and volumetric smoke to create an ephemeral, high-intensity moment. A microcontroller-driven stroboscope reacts to vocal intensity, while a smoke machine, activated just before the strobe, enhances the effect. Touch sensors ensure intentional activation, and the system dynamically responds to the participant’s energy.\n\n### Interaction\n\nThis is not a passive installation—it demands full engagement. Participants scream, and the system reacts in real time, pulsing light in sync with their intensity. The result is an electrifying moment of release, clearing the mind before the next adventure.\n\n### Team\n\n**Jonas Johansson** – Motion graphics & interactive media artist, handling technical execution.

Ti’ Punch to make your knees weak. But the moment we hit peak foxy hour—poof. It was over. We ran dry faster than you can say “you need to try the cocktail of the day!”\n\n### **🦊 This year, we’re thirsty for more.**\n\nWe’re upgrading the entire Foxhole drink experience—not just for the boozy babes, but for everyone. That means sexy low-ABV options, creative elixirs, zero-proof potions, and enough water containers to avoid dreaded 2AM water runs.\n\n**We’re going full foxy alchemist:**\n\n💡 Cutting edge tech = New methods to prep 10s of liters of citrus juice each night\n\n 💦 Hydration infrastructure = More water, less stress\n\n🍹 Scaling up = Keep cocktails flowing for 3x as long\n\nIt’s not about bigger parties. It’s about better experiences—for everyone who enters the velvet-draped dream.\n\n### **🎯 What this dream funds:**\n\n*   Bar build and infrastructure\n    \n*   Thermal drink storage & chill solutions\n    \n*   Hydration station expansion: water all night\n    \n*   Materials to streamline service flow\n    \n\nCamp fees will still help fuel the bar—but this dream makes it smoother, sexier, and sustainable.\n\n### **🍸 Why it matters**\n\nThe Foxhole bar isn’t just where we serve drinks—it’s where moments begin. It’s first sips and lingering glances. It’s the backdrop to stories you’ll blush about later. Whether you’re into mezcal, mocktails, or sparkling botanicals, we want every guest to feel welcomed, nourished, and just a little bit enchanted.\n\n### **🦊💧💋 Foxes drink well**\n\nHydrate. Taste.

We want **puppet making** and a **puppet theatre**! We want to play Burken (**Hide-and-seek**), Tag, Floor is Lava, **Tea parties** for us and our imaginary friends, **Story time** where you can cuddle up and hear or share your favourite stories. **Dress up parties** and **tattoos**! We even want to host a **tree climbing** workshop.\n\nThere will also of course be nap time and snack time because everyone needs more naps and snacks in their lives.\n\n**For your convenience one of our lovely camp members drew up a little rendition of what we imagine this little haven to look like.**\n\nIf you've made it this far into our proposal, welcome, and thank you for takin' the time. I hope by now we have managed to paint a pretty vivid image of our dream but let us break it down even more...\n\n**The Nitty and the Gritty:**\n\nThe things we want to build:\n\nTo make this happen, we need a space where all this goodness can go down, and our idea was to build (or rent - if necessary) something of a **playhouse** (see photos for inspo). Versatility is the name of the game in this dreamland, so the inside needs to be cozy enough for nap time, and story time, but also that it will be used for puppet making workshops + whatever other crafting and throwing epic tea parties.\n\nWe also want to build a little **tree** **jungle gym,** and a place to **swing** all day. For this we require accessibility to some trees (we promise to be kind and respectful to them and make it safe for all). We thought it could be fun for this to be a permanent or semi-permanent installation that can be a source of fun for years to come.\n\nThe goal is to borrow and buy second hand as much as possible in order to minimise waste and keep the costs down - but alas we are still in need of some specific tools, props, and other goodies that require some financial cushioning...",

Instead of revealing the real world, the telescope presents a shifting AR landscape, dynamically altered by real-time image processing.\n\nAs participants rotate the telescope, the stampede reacts in turn, maintaining the illusion that the animals are thundering directly towards them. The creatures—ranging from endangered species to imaginary hybrids—are partially designed using pre-existing 3d animations of animals, a combination of Tilt Brush and 3d illustration techniques, as well as AI tools (Meshy.ai). A small speaker embedded in the telescope adds an extra layer of immersion, letting those nearby hear the distant rumble of hooves and movement.\n\n### Structure & Materials\n\nA repurposed telescope serves as the primary viewing device, modified to house a smartphone at the eyepiece without revealing its presence. The smartphone’s high-resolution screen and camera work together to replace reality with the AR-generated stampede, creating a seamless illusion of movement and scale. Mounted on a gyroscopic base, the telescope allows smooth rotation, enabling participants to shift their perspective as they follow the chaos of the charging herd. The combination of optical precision, real-time rendering, and spatial interaction transforms a simple viewing experience into an immersive confrontation with an unstoppable force.\n\n### Interaction\n\nA lone telescope stands in an open field, unmarked and inviting. To a passerby, it appears as nothing more than an ordinary viewing device, silently suggesting an opportunity to peer into the distance. But the moment someone looks through it, they are met with an overwhelming, heart-racing sight—an immense stampede of animals charging straight towards them.\n\nAs they instinctively turn the telescope to take in the scene, the horde shifts in response, surrounding them in motion and chaos. The installation transforms a simple act of looking into a moment of adrenaline-fueled illusion, blurring the boundary between digital fiction and physical reality.\n\n### Inspiration\n\nTHE GREAT ESCAPE is inspired by the WebGL interactive web music video by Chris Milk and North Kingdom: [https://youtu.be/ReH7zzj5GPc.](https://youtu.be/ReH7zzj5GPc.) \n\n### Team\n\n**Jonas Johansson** – Artist, designer, educator (motion graphics, immersive media, audiovisual art).

This year, we’re reviving our Vagadome with a spicy twist.\n\n🌞 **By day**, our 7-meter geodesic dome is a creative bubble where you can push your boundaries and expand your consciousness as you join our birthday suit yoga, study consent like a cat, or make friends and (under the) influence people at a naked tea-party. All in a safe, respectful, and suitably weird way.\n\n🌠 **At night,** the dome unveils its many colours, transforming into a chill-out zone or low-key party space, where you can dance under the light of a thousand artificial stars or lay back and gaze up at the sparkling sky.\n\n💸 **Budget use:**\n\nThis dream was successfully funded last year (thank you once more!) and as always, we will bring back the existing gear.\n\n1.  💥 Urgent repairs & enhanced safety: Some of our LEDs didn't survive and need replacement. Some additional microcontrollers with microphones will be needed to improve reliability.\n    \n2.  🔥Weather protection:\n    \n    *   Additional skirt tarp to keep the water out (stretch goal)\n        \n    *   Get some **ventilation** in there. We had to abort workshops last year as our dome is a little greenhouse in the (rare) sun\n        \n    *   Additional soft Tatami floor puzzles to cover the entire ground\n        \n3.  🎜 Speaker and a microphone: We borrowed this for free last year.

Participants can claim a character or reclaim an identity that has been placed on them—transforming clothing into armor, accessories into tools, and roles into power.\n\nLed by a Brooklyn-based scenic installation artist and art therapist Brittany (creator of “Paint Your Feelings” at Borderland and costume lead at Kostume Kult, Burning Man), this project brings the ethos of **Lost & Found Space, an interactive, DIY Arts, Crafts & Clothing Upcycling Store, inspired by my travels to Borderland and participation in the Lost & Found camp- A maker's space in Brooklyn, NY** to the Villa—bridging therapy, costume, and communal expression.\n\nWe will also host short workshops (optional!) where participants can explore the symbolic meaning of their chosen look, archetype, or reclaimed narrative—supported by creative guides including a collaborator who led the Sanctuary in 2024, Therapist and Visionary Bo Siriwadh.\n\nWe’ll source most materials through donations and upcycling from:\n\n*   Last year’s Lost & Found camp\n    \n*   Kostume Kult (Brooklyn, NYC)\n    \n*   My NYC-based art space “Lost & Found Space”\n    \n*   Local collaborators sourcing Swedish secondhand materials",

I’m building a list of reflective questions and could use your voice.\n    \n\n### At Borderland:\n\n*   **Setup and decoration:** Help build the dream portal space inside the Villa—painting, lighting, organizing costumes, and setting the scene.\n    \n*   **Facilitators and vibe-holders:** Join us in holding space! If you love supporting creative exploration, identity play, or story-based transformation, this is for you.\n    \n*   **Sewists & crafters:** Bring your skills and help others create their dream look or repair/upcycle their costume.\n    \n*   **Mirror guides:** Want to hold space while someone chooses or embodies a new identity? We welcome gentle mirrors, thoughtful listeners, and playful myth-weavers.\n    \n\n### What You'll Get:\n\n*   Connection, contribution, and meaning\n    \n*   Materials to explore your own identity through costume\n    \n*   Space to transform, inspire, and be inspired\n    \n*   Costumes!

However, not everything we planted was perennial, so we went back in October and covered up alot of the beds, so they would be ready for sowing in 2025.\n\nSo this year the plan is to go to Alversjö in May and:\n\n1.  Maintain the pathways in the garden by adding fresh woodchip.\n    \n2.  Plant and sow a lot of new flowers, vegetables and maybe a few trees in the garden.\n    \n3.  Have a soil test made, to make sure that we can eat what we grow in the garden.",

Any bed that is covered with a tarp is up for grabs and should be ready for sowing/planting. Feel very free to make the bed into an artistic expression with a mix of plants and other materials. The garden is in growth zone 4 or 5 and it is a good idea to check if the things you want to grow can survive in this climate. Also check if whatever you want to sow is considered an invasive species in the area.\n\n  \n\\- Create a unique piece of art, that fits into the garden. If you have an idea for an art piece that would fit in the garden, please bring it or build it on site! We hope that the garden will be filled with small creative contributions as we get closer to the Borderland. The basic design principle is keeping it as natural as possible, so think rock, wood, metal and not so much blinky lights, plastics and neon.\n\n  \n\\- Tend a bit to the garden when you are in Alversjö.

See here for a \"making of\" video from the older version:\n\n[https://vimeo.com/1044363452](https://vimeo.com/1044363452?share=copy)\n\nWhen it comes to funding, the budgeting is quite flexible, such that the installation can be scaled up or down based on the degree of funding received.

Whether you like it sweet, salty, spicy, sour, in a cup, on your body, in a cake, in flames or as an apéritif, we're here to satisfy your needs!\n\nThe two of us did a liquorice tasting last year, and we were overwhelmed by both the turnout and the warm greetings given to two first-timers. This year we want to make it even **better, bigger and tastier!**\n\nAll funds go towards liquorice and the setting to serve such a magical substance to the people. We have already started the research, and we wish to bring both famous classics and new experiences to you taste buds. The main event will take place as a tasting circle, where we'll also share stories and experiences we all have with this \\_\"love it or hate it\"\\_-candy.\n\nNew of the year is our dream to serve liquorice thought the **entirety of the magical week**, with a portable solution (preferably a wagon) able to satisfy your needs on the go. This requires close to full funding on the liquorice part, as we will prioritize to buy as much of the black gold as economically possible.\n\n**Come find us for the tastiest experience on the playa this year!**",

Together with our neighbours and other Borderlings, we perform this symbolic act with the intention to bring us closer to each other and to our true selves.\n\nLet us remind ourselves that we are always connected, regardless of whether we are sitting by the fire, roaming around Borderland, or existing elsewhere in the universe.",

Here’s a video: [https://youtu.be/yU1EPb-9QPs](https://youtu.be/yU1EPb-9QPs)\n\nVanessa and I would like to expand on the basic idea (geometric shapes of wood floating in the forest) at Borderlands this year, and build on the learnings from BTMFFFF. The exact design is still open, but elements for the full version include:\n\n*   Wood we either bring and/or use what’s locally available\n    \n*   Paracord or hemp rope (considerations here are breaking strength, visibility/contrast, MOOP-avoidance)\n    \n*   Black tension belts, to create strong lines to suspend from, plus padding for the trees so they come to no harm (think a slackline setup).\n    \n*   Whispers played back via a small sound system. A thought here was to use anonymized after-burn messages from last years borderlands, write our own, or in an extended version have a microphone + small processor that makes everything whispery.\n    \n*   Lighting either via small UV flood-lights or UV LED stripes\n    \n*   Maybe UV-paint\n    \n\nScaling down: Except for the wood, rope, tension belts and tree protection we hope to be able to borrow all other elements, or build in reach of some other projects UV floods. Worst-case it will be daytime-only.\n\nWe’re very open for feedback and collaboration, and already have a few people in mind we’d like to connect with who’re doing pieces with similar elements.\n\nThe budget below is based off very quick web searches.",

Is the bush glowing? You are fully entranced by the sounds as you realize it is a little haven surrounded and filled with beautiful foliage. There are dreamers inside entranced by the soundscape and foliage. Your curiosity gets the best of you. You enter.\n\nYou see that everyone is playing with the leaves. Their actions and motives are mysterious to you, but still you reach out to touch the leaves. Instantly you are transported to a liminal realm supported by the latent space. Ethereal and enchanting sounds evolve with every leaf you touch. Communication from beyond and through the natural world. You realize you are eavesdropping on Eden. Normally a practice forbidden by the gods, the Fernbot acts as a vessel to facilitate the communion giving you a glimpse of what lies beyond.\n\n\\_\n\nThe project will build out a space that is warm and inviting for participants, which is incorporated into the local foliage and lit up with colorful lights in the evening. We will fill the space with plants, ideally from the local environment. Inside of the space we will hook all or most of the plants up to sensors that produce electrical signals when touched or blown on with wind. These electrical signals will trigger pieces of a continually evolving soundscape with many different modalities which morphs as the participants and natural forces interact with the plants.\n\nAdditionally, we hope to incorporate a microphone that will take language inputs from the participants and provide generative feedback that transcends the usual modes of the system, making it a more immersive and personal experience for the participants. This will transport the participants into an ephemeral, dream-like realm that bridges the aether through an intimate and ethereal interaction between the participants, the plants, the music, AI, and the surrounding nature.\n\nThe installation and space will be roughly human height and participants will either be able to walk or crawl into the space. From the exterior, they will see a building made out of foliage, that is lit with colorful light and emanating ethereal sounds. As they enter the space, they will be immersed in sounds send surrounded by plants that react to their presence and behavior.\n\nWe want to make this project as a way to connect with nature at a deeply human level, using light, music, and technology, but that also reminds us we are one with nature via interaction and immersion with plants.\n\nThe installation is designed to run 24/7, but we may shut it down for quick adjustments or updates, and burn events.\n\nWe are a group of dreamers who came together in an extitutional community in France. None of us knew each other beforehand, but a deep connection led us to this idea and dream for the festival. We are writers, scientists, engineers, poets, and musicians who love to create and co-create in emergent spaces. One of us lives in Cornwall close by helping with logistical matters. Many of us are long time burners with experience of bringing artwork to burns - also the build and strike.\n\nWe would like to have a space with flat ground and no big sound sources around us.\n\nThe space will take up approximately 5m x 5m to set up a canopy that will contain the Fernbot.\n\nIf allowed and possible, all local organic materials (branches and leaves) to create the immersive environment will be sourced from local tree fall.\n\nExpensive items that are of value to the community, like lighting and speakers, can be left in Alversjö.\n\nThe same project has been proposed for Burning Nest, and we will update expenses to reflect this if we are awarded any funding from Burning Nest.",

Their magical lights are synchronized and so is their surround sound system.\n\nAs the creatures walks slowly between dance floors they remind you that the magic at Borderland might as well be in between a German Yoga class and Plutonia.

It’s your **Last Chance Saloon**, your **Final Warning**, your **One-Way Ticket to Questionable Choices.u**\n\nOur vision is to create a **dysfunctional sanctuary**, where _hospitality is optional_, _sarcasm is served ice cold_, and _warm beer is the only option_. It’s not just a bar—it’s a **state of poor judgment** you willingly enter.\n\nThe goal is to distort the traditional \"welcome\" with gritty ambiance, bizarre characters, and one clear message:**“It’s already too late to turn back.”**\n\n## **JOURNEY**\n\nThis dream began, fittingly, with a **bad idea**.\n\nSomeone said: _“What if the gate had a saloon run by unhelpful people, only serving warm beer, and handing out life-ruining advice?”_ And nobody stopped them. Since then, it’s become a ridiculous, beautiful monster fueled by community, chaos, and beer of questionable temperature.\n\nWe’ve created the vibe. We’ve rendered the vision. We’re recruiting misanthropic bartenders. We’ve drafted a list of dangerously bad advice.\n\nNow we just need your help to bring it all to life!\n\n## **MANIFESTATION**\n\n**What we’ll create:**\n\n*   A **weathered black canvas tent bar** with warm lighting and cracked charm.\n    \n*   The iconic **Bad Advice Bar sign**, prominently placed for all arrivals to question their choices.\n    \n*   **Wooden bar stools and sad Chesterfields**—perfect for brooding or arguing.\n    \n*   A bar stocked with only **warm beer**, served by **unfriendly, possibly scornful bartenders**.\n    \n*   A daily-updated **chalkboard of dangerously bad advice.**\n    \n*   The legendary **Threshold ATV**, used for beer runs and chaotic general mayhem.\n    \n*   And new this year: the **Insult Corner** — a designated space where **volunteers creatively roast members** on request (or unprompted) if they forgot to bring ID or membership info or similar. Think of it as radical emotional exfoliation.\n    \n\nWant to start your Borderland experience by being gently degraded in front of strangers while sipping a lukewarm beverage? You’ve come to the right place.\n\n**Dream funding** will help cover:\n\n*   Tent structure and weatherproofing\n    \n*   Lighting and decor (lanterns, signs and other)\n    \n*   Bar building materials and seating\n    \n*   Signage and visual identity\n    \n*   Warm beer storage (and maybe one cooler we _refuse_ to use)\n    \n*   Transport and setup logistics\n    \n\n## **ESSENCE**\n\nAt its core, **Bad Advice Bar** is a satire of guidance, a critique of welcome culture, and an embrace of the absurd. It is **radical self-unreliance**, **communal recklessness**, and a place to laugh at your own decisions before you even make them.\n\nWith features like **Insult Corner**, we invite Borderlings to explore **consensual humiliation**, **creative verbal abuse**, and the **liberation of not being taken seriously for a moment**.\n\nWe’re not here to help. We’re here to set the tone.\n\nAnd the tone is: **“Don’t say we didn’t warn you.”**",

In the side of your eye you catch a glimps of something shiny, and you steer your light curious steps towards it. Seemingly out of the woods you see the side of a Large tavern with open door, inside you see a welcoming atmosphere, chefs cooking and the promise of food and rest.\n\n**The Cheeky Badger Tavern provides a place for you to regroup - before you venture out on yet another journey.** ​\n\n​​​​​\n\n​​​​​As a guest in the tavern you can feel free to sit down, eat your meal at our tables and use the dishing facilities afterwards. . There will even be microwaves for heating, public power outlets and hot coffee. There are always large amounts of extra food from our meal plan, or donated beers. You must eat and drink it. Nothing must go to waste. Also - try to enjoy the show while you're at it. We host everything from poetry evenings or live music to drag shows and stand-up comedy. ​We create the stage - Borderland brings the show.\n\n​​​​\n\nThe tavern is open around the clock, but activities are focused around lunch & dinnertime and until midnight when the stage closes. Located in the high sound zone; we hope to provide a small oasis of grounding - which you may visit at any hour before venturing forth on your next quest. Just like Bilbo Baggins.\n\n​​​​​\n\nWith great effort the Kitchen Crew from the cheeky Badger Tavern managed to save themselves and get away with a lot of the kitchen equipment in the wake of the Captains Demise. To cook food is the calling, so we are returning to Borderland to brave the Dangers, feed the hippies and honor the Captain.  \n  \nBut we are lacking in cover from the weather. Our plan is to get a sturdy tent that can host ourself and our guest.  \n\nFor detailed budget see: [https://shorturl.at/JySAC](https://shorturl.at/JySAC)  \nThat is the yearly budget for our camp. What's highlighted in purple is whats part of the Dreamfund.\n\n​​​​​\n\n​​​​The pictures attached are from The Crossing of The Borderland in 2021, Borderland 2024 and rendered image about our plan for 2025 by Vanja. ​For detailed information about how the Cheeky Badger Tavern is organized and operates - see our project plan and contact information below.

By the softness. By the space. By the unending cascade of your own image.  \nIt is a place where the outside world fades, and you become infinite\n\n### 💫 **What Happens Inside:**\n\n*   You **paint**, without rules or judgment.

After 47 years of desolation, survivors from Alversjö, guided by the mystical server they discovered in the woods, have revived the ancient sounds of heavy techno. The machine hall became their base, and one by one, the last struggling survivors of the apocalypse found themselves drawn here. Not just by the music but by a strange compulsion that seemed to vibrate deep in their bones. Perhaps a calling from the deep bass that once shook the world…\n\nIt became a city reborn. The roads around the machine hall were now busy with ravers, with UV clothes and bombastic laser shows, outshining the eerie glow of the dim, fractured sun.\n\nThe politics of the old world were forgotten. The only debates now were which type of techno should dominate the night and whether talking should be allowed on the dance floor. Heated arguments arose, but when the bass dropped, everything else faded away.\n\nLittle did they realize that they were about to form the next age of mankind, a world shaped by the vibrations of hardcore techno and the unspoken unity of those who danced.\n\nBut so they did, by cranking up the sound system and letting the music guide them into the new era. The world outside was lost, but the rave was just beginning… \n\n  \n  \n\nAre you up for the challenge? Will you allow humanity one last chance to shape the world (and hopefully get it right this time)? Will you put your trust in Mother Plutonia and the Techno Gods? \n\nWith your support we can secure mankind and a world beyond total apocalyptic doom…",

A legendary tea house established at Borderland 2017._\n\n_In times where everything is changing, it is sometime nice to find yourself in a familiar place such as a welcoming red tea tent where you can get friendly hugs, cuddles and tea brewed with lots of love. Warm and cozy place to ground yourself._\n\n### We will offer a reliable, warm, safe, cozy space to relax and decompress and experience the ancient gift of tea\n\nWe will provide a place where people can take a break, write a diary, read a book, meditate, take a nap, escape the FOMO, and just enjoy the sun together. The tent will be open during the daytime, and possibly by night if co-creation spirits want to create something special, and there might be an evening of music or improvisational sound jams or similar, depending on who wants to collaborate.\n\n### Hot and cold drinks\n\nDepending on weather we'll serve warm tea or cold drinks, and possibly some snacks. If the summer goes hot we'll have the coldest lemon sencha iced tea, and if it's rainy and stormy, we will make a fire in the wooden stove and brew some chai and invite to borderland’s cosiest warmest tent with the best downtempo ambience ever. You can sit, chill, and marvel at the beautiful lakeside view!\n\n### This year's theme: Vessels\n\nAs a contrast to our grounded tea house this year's teahouse will be influenced by the concept / story called **_Vessels._** _Vessels_ is a story about rebellion, and it will be told through visual art and interactive theatre / live roleplay in which you are very much welcome to participate. The theme will inspire us to dream together, creative costumes, and engage in live roleplay and secret missions on the playa.\n\n### The visual theme:\n\nThe visual style this year will be inspired by 70's sci-fi style visual art, super-8 film, lava lamps and feature a trip-cinema next to the fire stove.\n\nlink to Vessels:\n\n[https://cobudget.com/borderland/borderland-dreams-2025/cm8xfgjiy414560claoczvrcww](https://cobudget.com/borderland/borderland-dreams-2025/cm8xfgjiy414560claoczvrcww)\n\n\\-\n\nNotes on budgets:  \nWe need to get the tent by driving and transportation exceeds 20% of the dream budget, but we know from last year that this is the actual cost of driving from Alversjö to Malmö, renting a trailer, and getting it back. I don't see any other ways of doing it as the 150kg heavy tent does not fit in a car.\n\nStorage costs are 2750kr which is 50% of the total storage costs. The storage is 10 minutes from Alversjö and is 1.9m x 0.8m x 5.5m which is 8.4 m3. 5'500 is a fair asking price. The other 50% of storage cost is covered by the camp members. Given the material we've built up during the past 6 years (carpets, pillows, tables, canisters, samovars, boilers, water-canisters, lamps, wooden signs, etc), we need a place to store it between the years, otherwise, we would have to buy everything again and again.\n\nWe added this year the light rental for lighting the magical woods behind the camp since we are not sure if we will get the ones we have had in previous years which has been a joy for the whole Borderland and framing nicely the hills. We also need to renew some of our supplies since they are getting old (i.e. broken, moldy or not usable) like carpets, decorations and lights we have used for the past 6 years, so we want to offer something new and **fresh**!",

At the heart of the chamber flows an absinthe fountain, accompanied by a bar serving the fabled green elixir.\n\nAmbient electronic music weaves through the space — a shifting soundscape that visitors can subtly remix through their actions, creating a personal imprint on the atmosphere.\n\nPart laboratory, part ritual, part dream — _The Alchemist Chamber_ is a portal into the poetic fusion of magic and machine.\n\nLast year we brought the AI mirror, Touch Me Synth and Mushroom synth. This year we will bring similar tactile instruments and Experiments of Touch and creativity in different ways.\n\nStep inside and become a part of the experience!\n\nHeres a link to a post from last year with our heartfelt thank you to everyone that played with us that year.  \n[https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10160071702185911&set=gm.8418906848128674&idorvanity=682069748479128](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10160071702185911&set=gm.8418906848128674&idorvanity=682069748479128)\n\n**Why we’re investing in a tent**\n\nOne of the most stressful challenges in recent years has been securing a space — a tent, a roof, a shelter to protect people and equipment. Instead of renting a tent year after year, we’re now aiming to make a long-term investment by purchasing one of our own.\n\nThis will not only give us stability for future projects, but also reduce the need for recurring funding. If this tent is funded, it will be made available through Burner-Box for use in other events and collaborations.\n\nIve looked at the second hand market and we could probably secure a tent for 3 000 kr.  \nBut ideally we would purchase a 6 x 3 m quick-tent with black roof + walls. (a new one is on sale for 4 800 kr now, reg price 6 390 kr). A black tent (all second hand I found are white) would remove the need to \"hide\" the tent with fabrics. It's nice as it is.",

Wrapped around chrome, stripped of gravity, we dance ourselves into ecstasy—one breathtaking drop at a time.\n\n✨ **Climb. Tease.

To root us, to ground us. A place to bow our heads and be humble for all the things we don't know about life. For the longing of our souls. For connection to the great beyond. For a deep reverence of life.\n\nThis is a place for the things that don’t need words. A place to arrive and leave something behind. A place to breathe.\n\nTemples have long been a part of the Burning Man legacy: sacred, non-denominational places to process emotions, honor transitions, and witness each other without judgment. This dream brings that tradition into Nordic soil, surrounded by the natural world.\n\nParticipants are welcome to come alone, in pairs, or in quiet groups to reflect, journal, cry, or simply sit.\n\nThe temple becomes an anchor point in the wildly alive landscape of Borderland.\n\nSincerly,\n\nAmanda Mungsgård, Jonas Johnsson, Eric Lohela aka Dragonfly. We bring experience in ceremony, connection to the great mystery, spatial design, and festival care culture.\n\nBig ideas we are inspired by:\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf9uEGRicd0RP2mURPgaVOUi9iEhBRdQYPe5q2OCFwPOY8XQYrbyJQSPffowl2uEu-RL2c6eMEBW0xLJl60YKmhx8jl24KCALA1jR5Qjo6YYqKrE4LxGtAtcVmhkuq4sTThQO1T?key=xsxSwjzxRwa2aIt80044eKwI)\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcXyoJ7eLNf7ioX8d2Ow8r7wb-RfSi9VkBklRJQMPRV4VWjT1MxZX7dguvFG21qkaTeYZBW3ZcBGmzWleALOAUBlEimG3Thj2I5lNWDXPKnwrQLoaDvvA-epPjraGs5cmns9ys?key=xsxSwjzxRwa2aIt80044eKwI)\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcKJA7NTPKotDiNwF6fukPhWi0uk8qqESdYe-d6E-cA_qgg30oRLmMf9h2OsOP2Oz35wbXk-PDMNwrqHdE-1uhAFdibXx2mbK2lmVOtdwPdF9UPk0PuogLlfCPvSqemlbGUSUg2SQ?key=xsxSwjzxRwa2aIt80044eKwI)",
